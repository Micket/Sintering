\begin{abstract} % abstract
The computational framework for Variationally Consistent Homogenization (VCH) of (near) incompressible solids is discussed.
To focus on the important issues, a model problem is considered for a composite whose constituents are characterized by nonlinear (hyper)elasticity and linear kinematics.
A canonical formulation of the subscale problem, pertinent to a Representative Volume Element (RVE), is established, whereby complete macroscale incompressibility is obtained straightforwardly as the limit situation when all constituents are incompressible.
The framework is sufficiently general to allow for the classical boundary conditions on the RVE as well as the generalized situation of weakly periodic boundary conditions.
Numerical results, demonstrating the seamless character of the computational algorithm at the fully incompressible, limit conclude the paper.
