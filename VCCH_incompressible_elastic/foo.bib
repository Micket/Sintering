abstract = {The paper investigates algorithms for the computation of homogenized stresses and overall tangent moduli of microstructures undergoing small strains. Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems. We demonstrate their performance for some representative model problems including elastic–plastic deformations of composite materials.},

abstract = {The paper presents a framework for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structure, which undergoes non-isothermal inelastic deformations at large strains. The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.},

abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

abstract = {A constitutive model for powders in the initial rearrangement stage of liquid phase sintering (LPS), where capillary force is the driving force for densification, is developed in this paper. The formulation is based on certain theories in micromechanics of granular materials (see Mehrabadi et al., 1992a; Mehrabadi et al., 1992b; Nemat-Nasser and Mehrabadi, 1983; Nemat-Nasser and Mehrabadi, 1984; Christoffersen et al., 1981). The anisotropic mechanical behavior of powder system is analyzed by considering the behavior of interparticle force and fabric which is represented by the distribution of contact normals. The proposed model is used to determine the dependence of the overall volume change on such factors as local liquid volume, uniformity of liquid distribution, contact angle, initial particle distance, initial confining pressure, particle size and viscosity. The numerical and theoretical analyses in this paper indicate that small particle size, small contact angle, low viscosity, even distribution of liquid phase and loose green powder mass enhance the amount of volume change in the initial stage of LPS. It is also found that a higher confining pressure increases the densification rate but it lowers the amount of net volume shrinkage at the end of the initial stage. The anisotropic behavior of the sample is analyzed by studying the interparticle force change and fabric change during the sintering.},

abstract = {Densification and shape distortion are two important events associated with liquid phase sintering. In general, the initial porosity effects on both are ignored due to the rapid densification typical to liquid phase sintering. To completely describe the sintering process, porosity and pore size effects should be included in any sintering model. In this study, samples differing in initial porosity were sintered and quenched from various points in a sintering cycle to track the porosity effect on densification and distortion. Sinterability of the compact was defined as the ratio of sintering stress to compact strength to predict the densification and linked with sample composition and porosity. Porosity influences how the sample distorts during sintering. A high initial porosity sample is more likely to collapse along the longitudinal direction while a low initial porosity sample tends to spheroidize.},

abstract = {A gradient-enhanced computational homogenization procedure, that allows for the modelling of microstructural size effects, is proposed within a general non-linear framework. In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE). This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill-Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects.},

abstract = {A quantitative model for liquid phase sintering is developed based on the following ideas. During heating a liquid phase forms, which is easily mobile, wets the solid particles completely, dissolves solid atoms and provides an easy diffusion path for them. The solid density increases by particle rearrangement and by the flattening of particle contacts. Driving (or retarding) forces result from capillary stresses, from applied mechanical stresses, from the pressure of gas entrapped in closed pores and from differences in chemical potential of the dissolved and precipitated matter. At higher densities the driving force may become very small, since the liquid pressure decreases and a negative contribution from the solid-liquid interface energy increases. At this stage grain coarsening plays an important role for the continued filling of larger and larger pores. The model is applied to describe nonisothermal densification curves measured on Si3N4 for various hold temperatures, axial stresses and green densities. Adjusting a moderate number of parameters all having a physical meaning leads to good agreement between theory and experiment.},
