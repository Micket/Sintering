	abstract = {Theoretical concepts of sintering were originally based upon ideas of the discrete nature of particulate media. However, the actual sintering kinetics of particulate bodies are determined not only by the properties of the particles themselves and the nature of their local interaction with each other, but also by macroscopic factors. Among them are externally applied forces, kinematic constraints (e.g. adhesion of the sample's end face and furnace surface), and inhomogeneity of properties in the volume under investigation (e.g. inhomogeneity of initial density distribution created during preliminary forming operations). Insufficient treatment of the questions enumerated above was one of the basic reasons hindering the use of sintering theory. A promising approach is connected with the use of continuum mechanics, which has been successfully applied to the analysis of compaction of porous bodies. This approach is based upon the theories of plastic and nonlinear-viscous deformation of porous bodies. Similar ideas have recently been embodied in a continuum theory of sintering. The main results of the application of this theory for the solution of certain technological problems of sintering are introduced including their thermo{\textendash}mechanical aspects.},

	abstract = {Liquid phase sintering of particle agglomerates is modeled on the mesoscale as the viscous deformation of particle-particle contact, whereby the single driving force is the surface tension on the particle/pore interface. On the macroscale, a quasistatic equilibrium problem allows for the prediction of the shrinkage of the sintering body. The present paper presents a novel {FE2} formulation of the two-scale sintering problem allowing for the transition to zero porosity, implying macroscale incompressibility. The seamless transition from compressibility to incompressibility on the macroscale is accomplished by introducing a mixed variational format. This has consequences also for the formulation of the mesoscale problem, that is complemented with an extra constraint equation regarding the prolongation of the volumetric part of the macroscopic rate-of-deformation. The numerical examples shows the sintering of a single representative volume element ({RVE)} which is sheared beyond the point where the porosity vanishes while subjected to zero macroscopic pressure.},

Substantially better agreement between the model and experimental data is now obtained, particularly in cases where grain growth has occurred.

This approach bridges the gap between unit models on the level of individual particles and the continuum behavior of very large packings of particles. Furthermore, since the model deals with individual particles, it is possible to predict the evolution of several details of packings that are important to the properties of the deformed part. Using this model the deformation of discrete powder packings under combined sintering and traction-induced compaction may be studied. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental data are presented for the sintering of a two-dimensional packing of mono-sized glass spheres.

It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension.

The particles are bonded perfectly by isolated contacts and deformation occurs by plastic yielding of material at and near these contacts. The configuration is treated as isotropic and homogeneous as far as particle size and properties are concerned. The results are considered valid for aggregates with densities ranging from about 60\% to around 90\% of the theoretical fully dense level. The yield surface is obtained from the plastic dissipation at necks between particles given an imposed macroscopically uniform strain rate. The contact yield surface resulting from this analysis is sensitive to pressure as well as to deviatoric stress. The plastic strain rate direction is outwardly normal to the yield surface. Densification takes place when pressure is present, but a notable feature is a vertex on the yield surface at the points of pure positive and negative pressure. Consequently, plastic flow in the presence of pure pressure is nonunique, and deviatoric components may be superposed on densification.},

To characterize the creep law, the macroscopic strain rate in the powder aggregate is specified and the energy dissipated in mass transport and interparticle shear is computed. This work rate is used in a potential to determine the macroscopic creep parameters. The effective macroscopic shear and bulk viscosities resulting from this model depend on the relative density of the powder and disappear at random close packed density.

Three-dimensional closed pores, however, which predominate during final stage sintering, can separate from migrating grain junctions. The separation process is modelled numerically and the conditions for separation are formulated. Analytical approximations for the pore mobility are shown to describe the numerical results well. They serve to establish effective mobilities of grain boundaries bearing pores in various configurations. Classical theories of grain coarsening are modified by using these effective mobilities. Mechanical constitutive models of sintering contain the grain size as an internal variable.

Third, approximate analytical solutions are developed based on a thermodynamic variational principle.

As such they are well suited to deal with variable stress and temperature histories as encountered by the material during inhomogeneous sintering. Where the similarity solutions are valid (zero stress, short times, small or large {$\delta$Ds/$\delta$Db)}, they confirm the results of the approximate method.

During heating a liquid phase forms, which is easily mobile, wets the solid particles completely, dissolves solid atoms and provides an easy diffusion path for them. The solid density increases by particle rearrangement and by the flattening of particle contacts. Driving (or retarding) forces result from capillary stresses, from applied mechanical stresses, from the pressure of gas entrapped in closed pores and from differences in chemical potential of the dissolved and precipitated matter. At higher densities the driving force may become very small, since the liquid pressure decreases and a negative contribution from the solid-liquid interface energy increases. At this stage grain coarsening plays an important role for the continued filling of larger and larger pores. The model is applied to describe nonisothermal densification curves measured on {Si3N4} for various hold temperatures, axial stresses and green densities.

	abstract = {Porous solids filled with liquid or gas play an important role in engineering, e.g., in material science, petroleum industry, chemical engineering, and soil mechanics as well as in biomechanics. Although porous media are of considerable practical significance the description of their mechanical and thermodynamical behavior has been unsatisfactory for a long time. The theory to describe the complex thermodynamical behavior of such saturated porous solids has come to certain well-founded conclusions only recently. It is the goal of this paper to show the historical development of the porous media theory, which already started in the eighteenth century, formed in some areas by polemic disputes and tragic events in the lifes of the scientists involved. Furthermore, the current state of the research into this subject is discussed, whereby the state of the development of the material independent basic equations and the constitutive theory is illustrated. For a certain class of models general theorems, such as minimum and maximum problems, are derived and the uniqueness of solutions of boundary value problems is proved.},

The governing continuum equations are based on porous media theory applied to an elastic{\textendash}plastic solid skeleton at small deformations. In the localization analysis, the concept of regularized discontinuity is extensively used at the application to the conservation laws of momentum and mass. As a result, we obtain a coupled localization condition that is preserved also in the numerical formulation. Attention is also given to the design of an overall numerical algorithm to solve the coupled set of non-linear finite-element equations that arise from the element-embedded band approach. In order to arrive at the proper design of the algorithm, we resort to a staggering between the continuous (global) problem and the discontinuous (element) problems. In the numerical examples, the algorithm is shown to be able to capture onset of localization as well as the progressive development of shear bands. In the examples, we study the influence of local and global (boundary) drainage conditions, and the internal friction angle to the failure mechanisms.},

The major mesostructural constituents are tungsten carbide ({WC)} particles and large pores, which are embedded in a contiguous cobolt (Co) matrix. A preprocessor code, which is based on Voronoi polygonization, was developed to generate the morphology with prescribed area fraction and size distribution of the constituents. In a continuum model, the {\textquoteleft}driving force{\textquoteright} that brings about the densification is the sintering stress, which is given a rational thermodynamic definition in the paper. This stress represents the boundary loading of a representative volume element ({RVE)} at free sintering, i.e. in the absence of macroscopic stresses. In such a volume element (or unit cell) the constituents {WC} and Co are assumed as viscoplastic non-porous solids. A generalized Bingham model (of Norton-type with hardening) seems to be sufficient to represent the creep properties, which are assumed to be of dislocation as well as of diffusion type. The temperature dependence of certain material parameters is discussed. Thermal expansion is accounted for.

Green compacts were formed using ethylene-bis-stearamide ({EBS)} as a pore-forming agent with the amount of polymer controlling the initial porosity.

In order to account for the temperature effect on the rate-dependent response during the sintering phase, the concept of viscoplastic admissibility is employed as part of the model framework.

The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

The quasi-static analysis is often required to find not only the initial shape of the liquid but also the static equilibrium state of a liquid body before a dynamic analysis can be carried out. In general, natural and industrial processes in which surface tension force is dominant are of dynamic nature. In this second part of this work, the dynamic effects will be included in the finite element model described in Part I. A fully Lagrangian finite element method is used to solve the free surface flow problem and Newtonian constitutive equations describing the fluid behaviour are approximated over a finite time interval. As a result the momentum equations are function of nodal position instead of velocities. The resulting ordinary differential equation is integrated using Newmark algorithm. To avoid overly distorted elements an adaptive remeshing strategy is adopted. The adaptive strategy employs a remeshing indicator based on viscous dissipation functional and incorporates an appropriate transfer operator. The validation of the model is performed by comparing the finite element solutions to available analytical solutions of a droplet oscillations and experimental results pertaining to stretching of a liquid bridge.},

	abstract = {This paper describes variational formulation and finite element discretization of surface tension. The finite element formulation is cast in the Lagrangian framework, which describes explicitly the interface evolution. In this context surface tension formulation emerges naturally through the weak form of the {Laplace{\textendash}Young} equation. The constitutive equations describing the behaviour of Newtonian fluids are approximated over a finite time step, leaving the governing equations for the free surface flow function of geometry change rather than velocities. These nonlinear equations are then solved by using Newton-Raphson procedure. Numerical examples have been executed and verified against the solution of the ordinary differential equation resulting from a parameterization of the Laplace-Young equation for equilibrium shapes of drops and liquid bridges under the influence of gravity and for various contact angle boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {Liquid phase sintering of particle agglomerates is simulated as the viscous deformation due to particle-particle contact, whereby the single driving force is the surface tension on the particle/pore interface. Particles are modeled as purely viscous fluids (with no elasticity). Computational homogenization is adopted for the {RVE} with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A surface motion algorithm was developed that requires complete remeshing of the {FE-mesh} based on a maximum deformation criterion. Since the particles are intrinsically incompressible, the macroscopic compressibility is determined from shrinking porosity in the substructure. The numerical examples include free sintering of an {RVE} and a fully coupled {FE2-simulation} of a specimen with inhomogeneous initial distribution of porosity.},
