\section{Background}
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Motivation --- Sintering of hardmetal}

% The sintering phenomenon on the mesoscale is driven by surface tension on the melted binder, and
% the homogenized effect of the surface tension is the so-called sintering stress.
% From the macroscopic perspective, the specimen (green body) shrinks due to this volumetric sintering stress. In the case of inhomogeneous
% initial density in the green body, the sintering can result in unwanted final deformations.

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item WC-particles in Co-matrix (binder metal)
  \item Precompaction $\rightarrow$ inhomogeneous ``green body'', porosity $\phi_0\approx$ 0.2--0.4
  \item Heating $\rightarrow$ thermal expansion, sintering driven by surface tension in melted Co, i.e. ``liquid phase sintering'' $\rightarrow$
        Fully dense final product $\phi=0$.
 \end{enumerate}
\alert{Note:} Inhomogeneous initial density may lead to defect product:\\ \textsuperscript{(i)}remaining porosity, \textsuperscript{(ii)}shape imperfection\\
\alert{Note:} Macroscopic compressibility despite \underline{assumed} intrinsic incompressibility of constituents until $\phi = 0$.

% A vital part of the simulation is the modeling of surface tension, which acts as the ``driving force'' for liquid-phase sintering.
% An extensive theory on boundary energy potentials has been developed by Steinmann \cite{steinmann_boundary_2008}, which has served as the basis for the surface tension modeling in this work.
% In short; equilibrium across a surface $\mathcal{S}$ represented by a thin shell bounded by the curve $\mathcal{C}$, as in \figref{fig:surfacestress}, can be stated as:
\begin{itemize}
\color{gray}

 \frametitle{Conclusions}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Variationally consistent homogenization suitable for sintering. Modeling framework allows for
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item surface tension
   \item seamless transition to macroscopic incompressibility (for vanishing porosity)
  \end{enumerate}
 %\item Homogenization for mixed $(\ta u, p)$-formulated elasticity
 \item FE\textsuperscript{2} implementation $\leadsto$ Prediction of final shape, i.e.\ a simulation tool towards the design of near.net-shape manufacturing
 \item Evolving mesoscale topology: Surface tracking and remeshing algorithm
 \item Numerical results for Weakly Periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions on RVE
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item ``Sintering stress'' is highly dependent on pore shape (possibly anisotropic), advantage over macroscopic models!
   \item Bulk modulus of constituents can affect effective macroscopic shear modulus
   \item ``Hard'' particles $\leadsto$ Neumann boundary condition becomes an efficient alternative to periodicity
  \end{enumerate}
 \end{itemize}
% In this thesis a novel approach to simulate the sintering process as a problem of computational homogenization is presented, replacing traditional (macroscopic) constitutive modeling.
% With the proposed homogenization procedure, a seamless transition from the macroscopically compressible to the incompressible response is ensured, which is of vital importance when modeling sintering of particle composites.
% 
% Through rigorously applying VCH, we can ensure that the obtained macroscale problem is sound, and the RVE-problem retains the same strong form as the fine scale problem.
% These properties allow for a straightforward FE-implementation.
% 
% For the homogenization procedure, pores on the RVE-boundaries remain complicated.
% Weakly periodic and Neumann boundary conditions are not applicable, while Dirichlet boundary conditions constrains the closing of pores on the boundary.
% A strongly periodic boundary condition could therefore be a necessity for RVEs with pores intersecting the boundary, but makes it considerably harder to (re)generate a mesh.
