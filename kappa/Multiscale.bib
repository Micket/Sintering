	abstract = {A general method called {FE2} has been introduced which consists in describing the behavior of heterogeneous structures using a multiscale finite element model. Instead of trying to build differential systems to establish a stress-strain relation at the macroscale, a finite element computation of the representative volume element is carried out simultaneously. Doing so does not require any constitutive equations to be written at the macroscopic scale: all non-linearities come directly from the microscale.
In this paper, we describe how this method can be used in the context of generalized continua. For such continua, constitutive equations are very difficult to write, and a new set of material is difficult to fit to experimental data. The use of {FE2} models bypasses this problem because no analytical equation is needed at the macroscale.
An academic application is presented to show that generalized continua are necessary when the size of the heterogeneities increases, and that {FE2} models behave well compared to a reference solution.},

This transient scheme is an extension of the classical (first-order) computational homogenization framework. It is based on an enriched description of the micro{\textendash}macro kinematics by allowing large spatial fluctuations of the microscopic displacement field in contrast to the macroscopic displacement field, as a result of possible transient phenomena. From the microstructural analysis, the macroscopic stress and the macroscopic linear momentum are obtained from an extended {Hill{\textendash}Mandel} macrohomogeneity condition. In particular, the full balance of linear momentum is solved at both scales. Consistent time discretization towards the numerical implementation of the framework as well as a condensed formulation for linear elasticity are provided to ensure a more efficient calculation of the effective response. As an example, the transient computational homogenization approach is applied to the multi-scale analysis of a metamaterial subjected to dynamic uniaxial loading. Consistency of the framework with respect to Direct Numerical Simulations is shown for a large range of loading frequencies and microstructural sizes. Attenuation of the macroscopic waves at specific loading frequencies as well as size effects are highlighted.},

A continuous{\textendash}discontinuous computational homogenization{\textendash}localization framework is developed, which involves a discontinuity enhanced macroscale description. The underlying microstructural volume element ({MVE)} enables the incorporation of a band with high strains, i.e. a localization band. For the multi-scale coupling, special scale transition relations are established to handle the underlying material response of both the bulk and the localization zone. At a macroscopic (integration) point, the macroscale displacement jump and the deformation of the surrounding continuum material are used to formulate kinematical boundary constraints for the microscale {MVE} problem. Upon proper averaging of the {MVE} response, the macroscopic generalized stress is obtained. Simultaneously, a microscale effective displacement jump is recovered and returned to the macrolevel, based on the {MVE} deformation field. The equality of the macro- and effective microscale displacement jumps is enforced at the macroscale by Lagrange multipliers, being cohesive tractions at the interface. The applicability of the developed continuous{\textendash}discontinuous computational homogenization framework is illustrated on two simple benchmark problems involving evolving macroscale discontinuities as a result of microstructural degradation by void growth.},

	abstract = {Structural lattice models incorporating trusses and beams are frequently used to mechanically model fibrous materials, because they can capture (local) mesoscale phenomena. Physically relevant lattice computations are however computationally expensive. A suitable multiscale approach to reduce the computational cost of large-scale lattice computations is the quasicontinuum ({QC)} method. This method resolves local mesoscale phenomena in regions of interest and coarse grains elsewhere, using only the lattice model. In previous work, a virtual-power-based {QC} framework is proposed for lattice models that include local dissipative mechanisms. In this paper, the virtual-power-based {QC} method is adopted for lattice models in which bond failure and subsequent frictional fiber sliding are incorporated {\textendash} which are of significant importance for fibrous materials such as paper, cardboard, textile and electronic textile. Bond failure and fiber sliding are nonlocal dissipative mechanisms and to deal with this nonlocality, the virtual-power-based {QC} method is equipped with a mixed formulation in which the kinematic variables as well as the internal history variables are interpolated. Previously defined summation rules can still be used to sample the governing equations in this {QC} framework. Illustrative examples are presented.},

	abstract = {Structured and layered thin sheets are used in a variety of innovative applications, e.g. flexible displays, rollable solar cells or flexible electronics. Stacks of different materials, with often highly complex interconnects between layers, are thereby used, which are typically loaded in bending combined with intrinsic thermo-mechanical mismatches. As a result, different failure mechanisms at the level of the layered substructure occur, which constitutes a serious reliability concern. This paper deals with the two-scale homogenization of structured thin sheets, whereby a higher-order through-thickness representative volume element ({RVE)} is used. The methodology relies on the computational homogenization of the mechanics of microstructures, for which first-order and second-order solution strategies have been developed in the past decade. The upscaling of the deformation of structured thin sheets towards a shell-type continuum is second-order in nature. The higher-order kinematics is defined on the basis of a microstructural {RVE}, which represents the full thickness of the macroscopic structure and a periodic in-plane cell (e.g. a single pixel in a flexible display). The elaboration of the boundary conditions and the solution of the micro-scale boundary value problem are discussed. The obtained micro-scale stress state is homogenized towards a {3D} macroscopic shell structure, for which detailed aspects will be emphasized. The coupled numerical solution strategy is briefly outlined. Finally, an example is given and the application to a number of practical problems is highlighted, where the solution provides direct information on each scale. The incorporation of failure events at the substructure level is thereby naturally at hand. {\textcopyright} 2007 {IOP} Publishing Ltd.},

Due to the inhomogeneous nature of the porous material in the thickness direction, the length scale of the deformation-field variations in the thickness direction is in the same order of magnitude as in the microstructure. To resolve this issue a higher-order stress-resultant shell formulation (with linear variation of the thickness stretch) based on multiscale homogenization is considered. The microscale is accounted for by calculating the micro-fluctuations from a boundary value problem over the domain of a {3D} representative volume element ({RVE).} The breadth and width of the {RVE} are determined by the representative microstructure of the porous material, whereas in the thickness direction of the shell the {RVE} completely resolves the microscopic variation. As a result the macroscopic stress resultants are obtained as volume averages through the entire thickness of the shell. The nested solution scheme is quite computationally demanding and it should only be applied where it is needed. The paper is concluded by a couple of numerical examples that illustrate the method and support the arguments put forward in the paper. Comparison is made to a {2D} plane strain reference solution with complete resolution of the microstructure over the domain. Also a {3D} case is considered, showing the significance of resolving the microscopic fluctuations.},

Researchers are now fully convinced that this should be part of any numerical modelling and try to incorporate the methodology to their problems. Even the industry begins to require such an approach to increase the quality of the numerical results and to get more effective analyses to increase the ratio between computer costs and target error level. The adaptive strategy has first been applied to linear elliptic problems, e.g. linear infinitesimal elasticity [1,6,17,11]). It is now enlarged to nonlinear and transient problems [12{\textendash}16,5,10,17]. It is the aim of this paper to illustrate the application of the technique of residuals to adaptive refinement of coupled problems and to elastic wave propagation. There are many other approaches to a posteriori error estimations. Some of them appear to be difficult to extend to coupled and transient problems. It is believed that the residual approach is versatile enough to be easily applied to more complex problems. The two basic ideas used here rely on a space-time Galerkin formulation which provides a variational formulation of the error with respect to the residual, and the adjoint state which gives an upper bound of the error by the norm of the residuals weighted by some power of h and $\Delta$t, extending the ideas of Eriksson et al. [5].},

The algorithm is based on sequential lamination, but the evolution of the microstructure during a deformation process is required to satisfy a continuity constraint, in the sense that the new microstructure should be reachable from the preceding one by a combination of branching and pruning operations. All microstructures generated by the algorithm are in static and configurational equilibrium. Owing to the continuity constraint imposed upon the microstructural evolution, the predicted material behavior may be path-dependent and exhibit hysteresis. In cases in which there is a strict separation of micro- and macrostructural lengthscales, the proposed relaxation algorithm may effectively be integrated into macroscopic finite-element calculations at the sub-grid level. We demonstrate this aspect of the algorithm by means of a numerical example concerned with the indentation of a {Cu{\textendash}Al{\textendash}Ni} shape memory alloy by a spherical indenter.},

A rational interface theory based on damage development coupled to inelastic slip and dilatation is developed. The theory uses the interface width as a constitutive parameter, which regularizes the theory of {LEMAITRE} [1992], that is restricted to perfect bond between grain and matrix. In a series of {FE-analyses} parameter variations were performed: The unit cell size (as compared to the average grain diameter), the grain-matrix area ratio, the interface width and constitutive parameters. It appears that the composite behavior can be designed as brittle or ductile solely depending on the strength and rate of damage development in the interfaces.

An innovative transformation of the indefinite local problem into an equivalent symmetric positive definite system makes the solution of the local problem possible either by a direct solver without pivoting or by a preconditioned iterative method. Alternative semi-iterative solution procedures for the case when auxiliary coarse grid is not available, are also developed. This includes a multigrid-like scheme that uses a mathematical model based on the collocation formulation as the auxiliary grid.

In this contribution, we discuss a posteriori error control of the material forces as part of an adaptive strategy to reduce the discretization error to an acceptable level. The data of the dual problem involves the quite non-conventional tangent stiffness of the (material) Eshelby stress tensor with respect to a variation of the (physical) strain field. The suggested strategy is applied to the common fracture mechanics problem of a single-edged crack, whereby different strategies for computing the J-integral are compared.

	abstract = {Composites or multi-phase materials are characterized by a distinct heterogeneous microstructure. The failure modes of these materials are governed by several micromechanical effects like debonding phenomena and matrix cracks. The overall mechanical behavior of composites in the linear as well as the nonlinear regime is not only governed by the material properties of the components and their bonds but also by the material layout. In the present contribution the material structure is resolved and modeled on a small scale allowing to deal with these effects. For the numerical simulation we apply a combination of the extended finite-element method (X-{FEM)} [N. Mo{\"e}s, J. Dolbow, T. Belytschko, A finite element method for crack growth without remeshing, Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg. 46 (1999) 131{\textendash}150] and the level set method ({LSM)} [S. Osher, J. Sethian, Fronts propagating with curvature dependent speed: algorithms based on {Hamilton{\textendash}Jacobi} formulations, J. Comput. Phys. 79 (1988) 12{\textendash}49]. In the X-{FEM} the finite-element approximation is enriched by appropriate functions through the concept of partition of unity. The geometry of material interfaces and cracks is described by the {LSM.} The combination of both, X-{FEM} and {LSM}, turns out to be very natural since the enrichment can be described and even constructed in terms of level set functions. In order to project the material behavior modeled on a small scale onto the large or structural scale, we employ the variational multiscale method ({VMM)} [T. Hughes, G. Feijoo, L. Mazzei, J.-B. Quiney, The variational multiscale method {\textendash} a paradigm for computational mechanics, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 166 (1998) 3{\textendash}24]. This concept is based on an additive split of the displacement field into large and small scale parts. For an efficient solution of the discrete problem we postulate that the small scale displacements are locally supported; in order to achieve this objective one has to assume appropriate constraint conditions. It can be shown that the applied numerical model allows a considerable flexibility concerning the variation of the material design and consequently of the mechanical behavior of a composite.},

Due to the strong non-linearities involved in phase transformations, it is necessary to use a fine resolution in space-time in a finite element approximation in order to meet accuracy requirements. We derive space-time {FE-methods} based on the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin method in time for the energy equation. This formulation integrates the stored energy exactly for a given heat flux. When macro-segregation is incorporated into the model, the problem can be formulated in such a way that the phase-transition drives a flow of species. In addition, diffusion is possible throughout the domain. The model can be further rewritten using a potential approach. By this approach for modelling macro-segregation, we are able to obtain discretizations that guarantee that the balance equations are satisfied, and it is possible to solve the phase-transition problem either as a field problem or as a local problem (defined by a local evolution rule).},

This requires a product development process that utilizes the possibility to simulate the product performance using modeling of different degrees of sophistication at any predefined level-of-detail ({LOD).} For example, the mechanical properties of a cast component depend strongly on the casting process, the simulation of which requires complex modeling at a high {LOD.} In this article, we propose an optimization strategy that is based on the {LOD} concept to develop cost-effective components. A sizing optimization of a cast model component is carried out with respect to both the mechanical and thermal response to exemplify the process. In particular, a (novel) global measure of the temperature in energy norm is introduced as an indicator of the {\textquotedblleft}production fitness{\textquotedblright} to ensure high quality of the material properties. This measure is the thermal counterpart of the well-accepted mechanical strain energy.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-scale approach for the mechanical and numerical modelling of materials with microstructure-like concrete or fibre-reinforced concrete in the non-linear regime. It addresses applications, where the assumption of scale separation as the basis for classical homogenization methods does not hold. This occurs when the resolution of micro and macro scale does not differ ab initio or when evolving fluctuations in the macro-fields are in the order of the micro scale during the loading progress. Typical examples are localization phenomena. The objective of the present study is to develop an efficient solution method exploiting the physically existing multiscale character of the problem. The proposed method belongs to the superposition-based methods with local enrichment of the large-scale solution {\=u} by a small-scale part u'. The main focus of the present formulation is to allow for locality of the small-scale solution within the large-scale elements to achieve an efficient solution strategy. At the same time the small-scale information exchange over the large-scale element boundaries is facilitated while maintaining the accuracy of a refined complete solution. Thus, the emphasis lies on finding appropriate locality constraints for u'. To illustrate the method the formulation is applied to a damage mechanics based material model for concrete-like materials.},

Based on an appropriate dual problem, we compute a posteriori the discretization error contributions from approximations of the parameter, state and costate fields in space{\textendash}time for an arbitrarily chosen goal-oriented error measure of engineering significance. Such a measure can be used in an adaptive strategy (not discussed in this paper) to meet a predefined error tolerance. An important observation is that the Jacobian matrix associated with the resulting Newton method is used (in principle) in solving the dual problem. Rather than treating the Jacobian in a monolithic fashion, we utilize a sequential solution strategy, whereby the {FE-topology} of the discretized state problem is used repeatedly. Moreover, the proposed solution strategy lends itself naturally to the computation of first and second order sensitivities, which are obtained with little extra computational effort. Numerical results are given for the prototype model of confined aquifer flow with spatially non-homogeneous permeability.

The connection of scales is based on the principle of volume averaging and the Hill-Mandel macrohomogeneity condition. The latter leads to the determination of different types of boundary conditions for the representative volume element and in this way to the postulation of a well-posed problem at this level. The numerical examples presented in the contribution investigate the effective material behavior of microporous media. An isotropic and a transversally anisotropic microstructure are simulated by choosing an appropriate orientation and geometry of the representative volume element in each Gauss point. The results are verified by comparing them with Hashin-Shtrikman's analytic bounds.

	abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

	abstract = {This thesis deals with the modeling and simulation of the influence of the material substructure on the macroscopic mechanical properties of duplex stainless steel ({DSS).} Two subscale levels and their interaction are considered: Grain structure (mesoscale) and crystallographic structure (microscale). Typical mesoscale parameters are the volume fraction, morphology and material properties of the two phases (ferrite and austenite). A multiscale modeling approach is adopted, whereby it is assumed that the macro- and mesoscales are separated such that it is possible to model the subscale effects within a representative volume element ({RVE)} and to obtain the macroscale response via volume averaging (computational homogenization). A new microscale material model based on crystal (visco)plasticity and damage has been developed as part of the thesis work. This model is used to study the evolution of damage within the grain structure of the {RVE.} The important issue of parameter identification of the material parameters in the crystal plasticity model is also considered. Specifically, the necessary macroscale experiments needed for obtaining a unique set of material parameter values is exploited. Finally, concurrent ({FE\${\textasciicircum}2\$)} multiscale modeling simulations are performed. Different types of plane stress conditions in {2D} simulations and the computation of the corresponding macroscale algorithmic tangent stiffness ({ATS)} tensor are discussed. The concurrent simulations are used for investigating the influence of cold{\textendash}working on the macroscale mechanical properties for a thin metal sheet with strongly inhomogeneous deformation and stress states.},

The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous structures like composites often need a fine-scale resolution of micro-effects which influence the macroscopic overall response. This is of particular relevance in the fully non-linear range of large strains and inelastic material response of the constituents. Suitable solution methods introduce a multifield scenario of hierarchically superimposed states on different length scales. For big differences of micro- and macro-scales, the argument of scale separation induces the application of homogenization methods. Such types of physical multiscale approaches can be treated by nested multilevel finite element analyses that discretize both the fine-scale micro-structure as well as the macroscopic boundary-value problem. In contrast, small-scale differences require full resolution of the heterogeneous structure. Effective solution methods for the resulting large-scale problems with strongly oscillating properties are suitably designed geometric multigrid techniques, which may be considered as numerical multiscale approaches. In both scenarios, a key ingredient is the suitable formulation of scale bridging algorithms that govern the transfer between different scales. The paper outlines new mesh-bridging techniques in a deformation-driven context for fully non-linear response, which exploit in a non-trivial manner weak constraints on the average deformation in typical finite element patches. The framework is based on an incremental variational structure of finite inelasticity. The proposed new formulations provide variational-based homogenization algorithms for physical multiscale scenarios and problem-dependent optimal finite element grid transfers for numerical multiscale scenarios of heterogeneous materials.},

Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems.

The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure.

Focus is on the simulation of complex failure patterns. For that purpose, a cohesive-type constitutive model is adopted and further elaborated. More precisely, a traction-separation law connecting the stress vector acting at a certain surface to a displacement jump such as a crack opening displacement is considered. A numerically efficient implementation of this non-standard model is one of the ultimate goals of the present thesis. The advocated finite element formulation allows for a broad range of different constitutive models. Furthermore, no restrictions regarding the space of the continuous displacement approximations are required, i.e., higher-order polynomials can be applied as well. For estimating the quality of the numerical solution a novel class of adaptive methods is presented in the second part of the thesis. Assuming the considered mechanical problem is driven by a variational principle such as energy minimization, so-called variational adaptive finite element formulations are developed. Within those methods, the state variables and the deformation mapping as well as an improved discretization are computed from the same overriding principle. The performance of those variational mesh adaptions is illustrated by means of two prototypes: variational r-adaptivity and variational h-adaptivity. Finally, the coupling of cohesive finite element formulations and variational mesh adaption is briefly discussed.},

More precisely, focus is on finite strain plasticity theory based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. Adopting the formalism of standard dissipative solids which allows to describe constitutive models by means of only two potentials being the Helmholtz energy and the yield function (or equivalently, a dissipation functional), finite strain plasticity is recast into an equivalent minimization problem. In contrast to previous models, the presented framework covers isotropic and kinematic hardening as well as isotropic and anisotropic elasticity and yield functions. Based on this approach a novel numerical implementation representing the main contribution of the paper is given. In sharp contrast to by now classical approaches such as the return-mapping algorithm and analogously to the theoretical part, the numerical formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all unknown variables follow naturally from minimizing the energy of the considered system. Consequently, several different numerically efficient and robust optimization schemes can be directly employed for solving the resulting minimization problem. Extending previously published works on variational constitutive updates, the advocated model does not rely on any material symmetry and therefore, it can be applied to a broad range of different plasticity theories. As two examples, an anisotropic Hill-type and a Barlat-type model are implemented. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and the performance of the proposed implementation.},

Moreover, the choice of parameterization for the sought input, sampling instances of measurement data and discretization of the state problem are all decoupled, in contrast to standard methods such as Dynamic Programming. In this paper, the optimization problem is solved by seeking a stationary point of the pertinent Lagrangian functional, resulting in a Newton-type iterative algorithm.

This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption. The accuracy and robustness of the variational constitutive updates is demonstrated with the aid of convergence tests involving the finitely-deforming Mises solid and ductile single crystals. The ability of the updates to resolve the complex patterns of slip activity which arise in the latter application is particularly noteworthy.},

Since generally there is no periodicity in real random media, the {RVE} can only be approached approximately on finite scales.

	abstract = {An area at the intersection of solid mechanics, materials science, and stochastic mathematics, mechanics of materials often necessitates a stochastic approach to grasp the effects of spatial randomness. Using this approach, Microstructural Randomness and Scaling in Mechanics of Materials explores numerous stochastic models and methods used in the mechanics of random media and illustrates these in a variety of applications. The book first offers a refresher in several tools used in stochastic mechanics, followed by two chapters that outline periodic and disordered planar lattice (spring) networks. Subsequent chapters discuss stress invariance in classical planar and micropolar elasticity and cover several topics not yet collected in book form, including the passage of a microstructure to an effective micropolar continuum. After forming this foundation in various methods of stochastic mechanics, the book focuses on problems of microstructural randomness and scaling. It examines both representative and statistical volume elements ({RVEs/SVEs)} as well as micromechanically based stochastic finite elements ({SFEs).} The author also studies nonlinear elastic and inelastic materials, the stochastic formulation of thermomechanics with internal variables, and wave propagation in random media. The concepts discussed in this comprehensive book can be applied to many situations, from micro and nanoelectromechanical systems ({MEMS/NEMS)} to geophysics.},

The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail. A nested finite element solution procedure is outlined, and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some illustrative example problems.},

	abstract = {We present a method for the computation of upper and lower bounds for linear-functional outputs of the exact solutions to the two dimensional elasticity equations. The method can be regarded as a generalization of the well known complementary energy principle. The desired output is cast as the supremum of a quadratic-linear convex functional over an infinite dimensional domain. Using duality the computation of an upper bound for the output of interest is reduced to a feasibility problem for the complementary, or dual, problem. In order to make the problem tractable from a computational perspective two additional relaxations that preserve the bounding properties are introduced. First, the domain is triangulated and a domain decomposition strategy is used to generate a sequence of independent problems to be solved over each triangle. The Lagrange multipliers enforcing continuity are approximated using piecewise linear functions over the edges of the triangulation. Second, the solution of the adjoint problem is approximated over the triangulation using a standard Galerkin finite element approach. A lower bound for the output of interest is computed by repeating the process for the negative of the output. Reversing the sign of the computed upper bound for the negative of the output yields a lower bound for the actual output. The method can be easily generalized to three dimensions. However, a constructive proof for the existence of feasible solutions for the outputs of interest is only given in two dimensions. The computed bound gaps are found to converge optimally, that is, at the same rate as the finite element approximation. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that it allows for a data set to be generated that can be used to certify and document the computed bounds. Using this data set and a simple algorithm, the correctness of the computed bounds can be established without recourse to the original code used to compute them. In the present paper, only computational domains whose boundary is made up of straight sided segments and polynomially varying loads are considered. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

The conventional strategies for mesh refinement in {FE} models of problems from elasticity theory are mostly based on a posteriori error estimates in the energy norm. Such estimates reflect the approximation properties of the finite element ansatz by local interpolation constants while the stability properties of the continuous model enter through a global coercivity constant. However, meshes generated on the basis of such global error estimates are not appropriate in cases where the domain consists of very heterogeneous materials and for the computation of local quantities, e.g., point values or contour integrals. This deficiency is cured by using certain local norms of the dual solution directly as weights multiplying the local residuals of the computed solution. In general, these weights have to be evaluated numerically in the course of the refinement process, yielding almost optimal meshes for various kinds of error measures. This feed-back approach is developed here for primal as well as mixed {FE} discretisations of the fundamental problem in linear elasticity.},

	abstract = {It is explicitly shown that if the (spatial) elasticity tensor of an elastic material is taken as isotropic for all possible configurations, then its coefficients cannot be constants; they must depend nontrivially on the Jacobian determinant of the deformation gradient. Moreover, the assumption typically made for computational purposes that its coefficients remain constant for all possible configurations is incompatible with elasticity. It is further shown that an assumption widely used in the computational literature in the context of finite deformation plasticity, namely, relating an objective stress rate to the rate of deformation tensor through a fourth-rank constant isotropic tensor, is also incompatible with elasticity, thus furnishing an example of an hypoelastic material which is not elastic.},

	abstract = {Modeling of elastic thin-walled beams, plates and shells as {ID-} and {2D-boundary} value problems is valid in undisturbed subdomains. Disturbances near supports and free edges, in the vicinity of concentrated loads and at thickness jumps cannot be described in a sufficient way by {1D-} and {2D-BVPs.} In these disturbed subdomains dimensional (d)-adaptivity and model (m)-adaptivity have to be performed coupled with h- and/or p-adaptivity using hierarchically expanded test spaces in order to guarantee reliable and efficient overall results. The expansion strategy is applied for enhancing the spatial dimension and the model which is more efficient and evident for engineers than the reduction method. Using local residual error estimators of the primal problem in the energy norm by solving Dirichlet-problems on element patches, an efficient integrated adaptive calculation of the discretization{\textemdash}and the dimensional error is possible and reasonable, demonstrated by examples. We also present an error estimator of the dual problem, namely a posterior equilibrium method ({PEM)} for calculation of the interface tractions on local patches with Neumann boundary conditions, using orthogonality conditions. These tractions are equilibrated with respect to the global equilibrium condition of the stress resultants. An upper bound error estimator based on differences between the new tractions and the discontinuous tractions calculated from the stresses of the current finite element solution. The introduction of new element boundary tractions yields a method which can be regarded as a stepwise hybrid displacement method or as Trefftz method for local Neumann problems of element patches. An important advantage of {PEM} is the coupled computation of local discretization, dimensional- and model errors by an additive split.},

Generally, residual error estimators (which have at least upper bound in contrast to indicators) can be locally computed from residua of equilibrium and stress-jumps at element interfaces using Dirichlet or Neumann conditions for element patches or individual elements ({REM).} Another equivalent method for error estimation can be derived from a posteriori computed improved boundary tractions which provide exact equilibrium of elements. They are computed from local Neumann problems and yield improved local solution by testing with higher test functions. This method is called Posterior Equilibrium Method ({PEM)} and yields better efficiency indices than {REM} for the investigated problem, even in case of locking. Also, the important feature of model-adaptivity via hierarchical error estimation can only be realized by this strategy. Global Neumann-type estimators and examples are presented for elastic and elastoplastic deformations, controlling equilibrium in tangential space.},

The second related important matter is which physical/mathematical models{\textemdash}including various boundary layers and other disturbances{\textemdash}and which accuracy of the finite element solutions in which norm are prescribed and necessary for the safety and reliability of a certain engineering problem, e.g. in structural engineering, of course depending on materials, systems and the type as well as the magnitude of prescribed loadings (i.e. actions in a factorized concept) acting on a specific structure. It is hard to understand why the current regulations for structural engineering design in Europe{\textemdash}especially the European Standards (Eurocodes) and the relevant German {DIN-Codes} ({DIN:} Deutsches Institut f{\"u}r Normung e. V.){\textemdash}do not lay out any rules or bounds for the prescribed accuracy of the material and structural resistance, i.e. the validity of mechanical modelling and the accuracy of associated numerical methods, usually today the finite element method. It can be observed that behind the existing codes there still lies the old thinking of, e.g., classical elastic beam theory of so-called second order for stability problems and the corresponding elastic potential for plates and shells in buckling. Modern flexible finite element modelling by deriving theories in variational form for thin-walled beams, plates and shells from rather general {3D} theories, for both linear and non-linear problems, capturing inelastic deformations and layer effects by material and dimensional expansions are not addressed in the Eurocodes for structural engineering. The necessary consequence is that joint work of computational mechanics specialists and structural engineers, working in national and international code-committees, is absolutely necessary, in order to avoid a lot of costly troubles and dangers of today by improving and updating the codes.},

A condensation procedure that employs the tangent information from the microscale finite element analysis is derived within a special framework where deformation controlled boundary conditions in micromechanical testing are enforced via the penalty method. The developed methodology is demonstrated by sample macroscale problems in the context of the multilevel finite element strategy. Due to the high memory allocation costs that the condensation procedure induces, a perturbation procedure is developed based on a minimal number of micromechanical tests. Results from the condensation and perturbation procedures are compared for sample infinitesimal and finite deformation inelasticity problems and the algorithmic consistency of the macroscopic tangent with the evolution of the macroscopic stress is discussed. It is shown that the ability to compute the macroscopic tangent can also be employed to construct a stress controlled micromechanical testing procedure.},

The error inherent in a coarse model, compared to the fine datum, can be bounded by residual functionals unambiguously defined by solutions of the coarse model. Whenever there exist hierarchical classes of models in which levels of sophistication of various coarse models can be defined, an adaptive modeling strategy can be implemented to control modeling error.

The model is derived from the higher-order homogenization theory with multiple spatial and temporal scales. It is also shown that the modified higher-order terms bring in a non-local dispersion effect of the microstructure of multiphase materials.
