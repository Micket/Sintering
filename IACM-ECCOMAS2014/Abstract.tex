One unsolved problem in computational homogenization occur when dealing with macroscopic incompressibility.
Such a situation is encountered for a composite whose micro-constituents are intrinsically incompressible, e.g.\ incompressible inclusions in an incompressible matrix, which infers macroscale incompressibility as well.
Alternatively, an initially compressible macroscale response may become incompressible as the result of the deformation process.
An important example is the evolving porous microstructure of a powder metallurgy product during the process of sintering, whereby the effective response is compressible until the porosity vanishes inferring incompressible macroscale response.
This process is thus characterized by a transition from the compressible to incompressible regimes that should be handled within the same variational framework, c.f. \cite{Ohman2013}.
In the case of an incompressible microstructure, the traditional homogenization schemes are not applicable.

In this submission we show how to derive the system of macro- and micro-scale equations for dealing with macroscopic incompressibility.
The macroscale problem is derived as a mixed formulation (displacement and pressure) system where the deviatoric stress and the volumetric strain are obtained through homogenization of a Representative Volume Element (RVE). The microscale problem is derived as a mixed formulation (displacement and pressure) problem combined with Lagrange multipliers associated with the choice of boundary conditions. We show the essential boundary conditions on the RVE; Periodicity, Dirichlet, and Neumann.

Examples of the new homogenization scheme are shown for incompressible elasticity and emphasis is put on the bounds given by the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
