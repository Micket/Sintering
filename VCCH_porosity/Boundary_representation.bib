	abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid approach which combines theimmersed interface methodwith thelevel set approachis presented. The fast version of the immersed interface method is used to solve the differential equations whose solutions and their derivatives may be discontinuous across the interfaces due to the discontinuity of the coefficients or/and singular sources along the interfaces. The moving interfaces then are updated using the newly developed fast level set formulation which involves computation only inside some small tubes containing the interfaces. This method combines the advantage of the two approaches and gives a second-order Eulerian discretization for interface problems. Several key steps in the implementation are addressed in detail. This new approach is then applied to Hele-Shaw flow, an unstable flow involving two fluids with very different viscosity.},

	abstract = {We consider a standard model for incompressible two-phase flows in which a localized force at the interface describes the effect of surface tension. If a level set (or {VOF)} method is applied then the interface, which is implicitly given by the zero level of the level set function, is in general not aligned with the triangulation that is used in the discretization of the flow problem. This non-alignment causes severe difficulties w.r.t. the discretization of the localized surface tension force and the discretization of the flow variables. In cases with large surface tension forces the pressure has a large jump across the interface. In standard finite element spaces, due to the non-alignment, the functions are continuous across the interface and thus not appropriate for the approximation of the discontinuous pressure. In many simulations these effects cause large oscillations of the velocity close to the interface, so-called spurious velocities. In this paper, for a simplified model problem, we give an analysis that explains why known (standard) methods for discretization of the localized force term and for discretization of the pressure variable often yield large spurious velocities. In the paper [S. Gro{\ss}, A. Reusken, Finite element discretization error analysis of a surface tension force in two-phase incompressible flows, Preprint 262, {IGPM}, {RWTH} Aachen, {SIAM} J. Numer. Anal. (accepted for publication)], we introduce a new and accurate method for approximation of the surface tension force. In the present paper, we use the extended finite element space ({XFEM)}, presented in [N. Moes, J. Dolbow, T. Belytschko, A finite element method for crack growth without remeshing, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 46 (1999) 131{\textendash}150; T. Belytschko, N. Moes, S. Usui, C. Parimi, Arbitrary discontinuities in finite elements, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 50 (2001) 993{\textendash}1013], for the discretization of the pressure. We show that the size of spurious velocities is reduced substantially, provided we use both the new treatment of the surface tension force and the extended pressure finite element space.},

The method couples a semi-implicit discretization for solving the surfactant transport equation recently developed by Xu and Zhao [62] with the im- mersed interface method originally developed by {LeVeque} and Li and [31] for solving the fluid flow equations and the Laplace-Young bound- ary conditions across the interfaces. Novel techniques are developed to accurately conserve component mass and surfactant mass during the evo- lution. Convergence of the method is demonstrated numerically. The method is applied to study the effects of surfactant on single drops, drop- drop interactions and interactions among multiple drops in Stokes flow under a steady applied shear. Due to Marangoni forces and to nonuni- form Capillary forces, the presence of surfactant results in larger drop deformations and more complex drop-drop interactions compared to the analogous cases for clean drops. The effects of surfactant are found to be most significant in flows with multiple drops. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the level-set method has been used to simulate fluid interfaces with surfactant.},

	abstract = {We reproduce the general behavior of complicated bubble and droplet motions using the variational level set formulation introduced by the authors earlier. Our approach here ignores inertial effects; thus the motion is only correct as an approximation for very viscous problems. However, the steady states are true equilibrium solutions. Inertial forces will be added in future work. The problems include: soap bubbles colliding and merging, drops falling or remaining attached to a (generally irregular) ceiling, and liquid penetrating through a funnel in both two and three dimensions. Each phase is identified with a particular {\textquotedblleft}level set{\textquotedblright} function. The zero level set of this function is that particular phase boundary. The level set functions all evolve in time through a constrained gradient descent procedure so as to minimize an energy functional. The functions are coupled through physical constraints and through the requirements that different phases do not overlap and vacuum regions do not develop. Both boundary conditions and inequality constraints are cast in terms of (either local or global) equality constraints. The gradient projection method leads to a system of perturbed (by curvature, if surface tension is involved) {Hamilton{\textendash}Jacobi} equations coupled through a constraint. The coupling is enforced using the Lagrange multiplier associated with this constraint. The numerical implementation requires much of the modern level set technology; in particular, we achieve a significant speed up by using the fast localization algorithm of H.-K. Zhao, M. Kang, B. Merriman, D. Peng, and S. Osher.},

The significance of the method used to compute the normal direction at the finite element node points for a C$^{0}$ piecewise-polynomial free surface is investigated. In particular, it is demonstrated that the concept of mass-consistent normals on an isoparametric quadratic tetrahedral mesh is flawed. In this case an alternative, purely geometric, normal is shown to lead to a far more robust numerical algorithm.},

This fast local level set method reduces the computational effort by one order of magnitude, works in as much generality as the original one, and is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Our approach differs from previous relatedworks in that we extract all the information needed from the level set function (or functions in multiphase flow) and do not need to find explicitly the location of the interface in the space domain. The complexity of our method to do tasks such as extension and distance reinitialization is O(N), where N is the number of points in space, not O(N log N) as in works by Sethian (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 93, 1591) and Helmsen and co-workers (1996, {SPIE} Microlithography {IX}, p. 253).

A level-set method is employed as an alternative approach to the popular homogenization-based methods of rule of mixtures for multi-material modeling. A multi-phase level-set model is adapted for material and topology representation. This model eliminates the need for a material interpolation or phase mixing scheme. It only requires m level-set functions to represent a structure of n=2m different material phases, in a principle similar to combining colors from the three primary colors. Therefore, this multi-phase model may be referred to as a {\textquotedblleft}color{\textquotedblright} level-set representation which has its unique benefits: it is flexible to handle complex topologies; it substantially reduces the number of model functions when n{\textgreater}3; it automatically avoids the problem of overlap between material phases of a conventional partitioning approach. We describe numerical techniques for efficient and robust implementation of the method, by embedding a rectilinear grid in a fixed finite element mesh defined on a reference design domain. This would separate the issues of accuracy in numerical calculations of the physical equation and in the level-set model propagation. A gradient projection method is described for incorporating multiple constraints in the problem. Finally, the benefits and the advantages of the developed method are illustrated with several {2D} examples of mean compliance minimization of multi-material structures.},
