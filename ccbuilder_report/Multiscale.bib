	abstract = {At the development of commercial vehicles, it is necessary to develop cost-optimized components with respect to their entire lifetime. This requires a product development process that utilizes the possibility to simulate the product performance using modeling of different degrees of sophistication at any predefined level-of-detail (LOD). For example, the mechanical properties of a cast component depend strongly on the casting process, the simulation of which requires complex modeling at a high LOD. In this article, we propose an optimization strategy that is based on the LOD concept to develop cost-effective components. A sizing optimization of a cast model component is carried out with respect to both the mechanical and thermal response to exemplify the process. In particular, a (novel) global measure of the temperature in energy norm is introduced as an indicator of the “production fitness” to ensure high quality of the material properties. This measure is the thermal counterpart of the well-accepted mechanical strain energy.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous structures like composites often need a fine-scale resolution of micro-effects which influence the macroscopic overall response. This is of particular relevance in the fully non-linear range of large strains and inelastic material response of the constituents. Suitable solution methods introduce a multifield scenario of hierarchically superimposed states on different length scales. For big differences of micro- and macro-scales, the argument of scale separation induces the application of homogenization methods. Such types of physical multiscale approaches can be treated by nested multilevel finite element analyses that discretize both the fine-scale micro-structure as well as the macroscopic boundary-value problem. In contrast, small-scale differences require full resolution of the heterogeneous structure. Effective solution methods for the resulting large-scale problems with strongly oscillating properties are suitably designed geometric multigrid techniques, which may be considered as numerical multiscale approaches. In both scenarios, a key ingredient is the suitable formulation of scale bridging algorithms that govern the transfer between different scales. The paper outlines new mesh-bridging techniques in a deformation-driven context for fully non-linear response, which exploit in a non-trivial manner weak constraints on the average deformation in typical finite element patches. The framework is based on an incremental variational structure of finite inelasticity. The proposed new formulations provide variational-based homogenization algorithms for physical multiscale scenarios and problem-dependent optimal finite element grid transfers for numerical multiscale scenarios of heterogeneous materials.},

Within this framework the classical approach of (model-based) first-order homogenization for stationary problems is extended to transient problems. Homogenization is then carried out in the spatial domain on representative volume elements (RVE), which are (in practice) introduced in quadrature points in standard fashion. Along with the classical averages, a higher order conservation quantity is obtained. An iterative FE²-algorithm is devised for the case of non-linear diffusion and storage coefficients, and it is applied to transient heat conduction in a strongly heterogeneous particle composite. Parametric studies are carried out, in particular with respect to the influence of the ‘internal length’ associated with the second-order conservation quantity.},

Generally, residual error estimators (which have at least upper bound in contrast to indicators) can be locally computed from residua of equilibrium and stress-jumps at element interfaces using Dirichlet or Neumann conditions for element patches or individual elements (REM). Another equivalent method for error estimation can be derived from a posteriori computed improved boundary tractions which provide exact equilibrium of elements. They are computed from local Neumann problems and yield improved local solution by testing with higher test functions. This method is called Posterior Equilibrium Method (PEM) and yields better efficiency indices than REM for the investigated problem, even in case of locking. Also, the important feature of model-adaptivity via hierarchical error estimation can only be realized by this strategy. Global Neumann-type estimators and examples are presented for elastic and elastoplastic deformations, controlling equilibrium in tangential space.},

Through a variational approach, it is shown that each of them is bounded on one side. For cases fulfilling the Hill condition, these apparent modulus and compliance tensors are reciprocals. This provides two-sided bounds on each one. In this case, for a body smaller than the representative volume, the apparent elasticity tensor for mixed boundary conditions falls between the tensors associated with the static and kinematic uniform boundary conditions.

A key ingredient is an absolute (fixed) reference configuration, relative to which configurational and deformational changes (rates) with respect to the material (undeformed) and spatial (deformed) configurations, respectively, can be described in a unified fashion. In particular, we are interested in formulating the local as well as global measures of the energy dissipation due to configurational changes of a given physical system. It is believed that the presentation in this paper provides the following advantages: a unified kinematic and thermodynamic setting of the configurational and deformational motions, in particular the generic balance law accounting for configurational flux, increases the general clarity; the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the intrinsic change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation that is induced by configurational changes becomes transparent.

Moreover, the choice of parameterization for the sought input, sampling instances of measurement data and discretization of the state problem are all decoupled, in contrast to standard methods such as Dynamic Programming. In this paper, the optimization problem is solved by seeking a stationary point of the pertinent Lagrangian functional, resulting in a Newton-type iterative algorithm. Moreover, the sensitivity of the solution with respect to measurement noise may also be estimated from a perturbation analysis of the optimality conditions. Two numerical examples show that the approach produces results in agreement with those of standard methods, however, with the additional advantage the numerical properties of the considered problem may be investigated. In particular, such knowledge may be used for choosing a proper amount of regularization.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-scale approach for the mechanical and numerical modelling of materials with microstructure-like concrete or fibre-reinforced concrete in the non-linear regime. It addresses applications, where the assumption of scale separation as the basis for classical homogenization methods does not hold. This occurs when the resolution of micro and macro scale does not differ ab initio or when evolving fluctuations in the macro-fields are in the order of the micro scale during the loading progress. Typical examples are localization phenomena. The objective of the present study is to develop an efficient solution method exploiting the physically existing multiscale character of the problem. The proposed method belongs to the superposition-based methods with local enrichment of the large-scale solution ū by a small-scale part u′. The main focus of the present formulation is to allow for locality of the small-scale solution within the large-scale elements to achieve an efficient solution strategy. At the same time the small-scale information exchange over the large-scale element boundaries is facilitated while maintaining the accuracy of a refined complete solution. Thus, the emphasis lies on finding appropriate locality constraints for u′. To illustrate the method the formulation is applied to a damage mechanics based material model for concrete-like materials.},

The connection of scales is based on the principle of volume averaging and the Hill-Mandel macrohomogeneity condition. The latter leads to the determination of different types of boundary conditions for the representative volume element and in this way to the postulation of a well-posed problem at this level. The numerical examples presented in the contribution investigate the effective material behavior of microporous media. An isotropic and a transversally anisotropic microstructure are simulated by choosing an appropriate orientation and geometry of the representative volume element in each Gauss point. The results are verified by comparing them with Hashin-Shtrikman's analytic bounds.

The book first offers a refresher in several tools used in stochastic mechanics, followed by two chapters that outline periodic and disordered planar lattice (spring) networks. Subsequent chapters discuss stress invariance in classical planar and micropolar elasticity and cover several topics not yet collected in book form, including the passage of a microstructure to an effective micropolar continuum. After forming this foundation in various methods of stochastic mechanics, the book focuses on problems of microstructural randomness and scaling. It examines both representative and statistical volume elements (RVEs/SVEs) as well as micromechanically based stochastic finite elements (SFEs). The author also studies nonlinear elastic and inelastic materials, the stochastic formulation of thermomechanics with internal variables, and wave propagation in random media. The concepts discussed in this comprehensive book can be applied to many situations, from micro and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) to geophysics.},

Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems.

From the microstructural analysis the macroscopic stress and higher-order stress tensors are obtained, thus delivering a microstructurally based constitutive response of the macroscopic second gradient continuum. The higher-order macroscopic constitutive tangents are derived through static condensation of the microscopic global tangent matrix. For the solution of the second gradient equilibrium problem on the macrolevel a mixed finite element formulation is developed.

	abstract = {The interest in adaptive strategies for the finite element method is growing at a fast pace. Researchers are now fully convinced that this should be part of any numerical modelling and try to incorporate the methodology to their problems. Even the industry begins to require such an approach to increase the quality of the numerical results and to get more effective analyses to increase the ratio between computer costs and target error level. The adaptive strategy has first been applied to linear elliptic problems, e.g. linear infinitesimal elasticity [1,6,17,11]). It is now enlarged to nonlinear and transient problems [12–16,5,10,17]. It is the aim of this paper to illustrate the application of the technique of residuals to adaptive refinement of coupled problems and to elastic wave propagation. There are many other approaches to a posteriori error estimations. Some of them appear to be difficult to extend to coupled and transient problems. It is believed that the residual approach is versatile enough to be easily applied to more complex problems. The two basic ideas used here rely on a space-time Galerkin formulation which provides a variational formulation of the error with respect to the residual, and the adjoint state which gives an upper bound of the error by the norm of the residuals weighted by some power of h and Δt, extending the ideas of Eriksson et al. [5].},

	abstract = {In this paper, a multi-scale technique is proposed for the modeling of microstructured materials up to the point of macroscopic failure. A continuous–discontinuous computational homogenization–localization framework is developed, which involves a discontinuity enhanced macroscale description. The underlying microstructural volume element (MVE) enables the incorporation of a band with high strains, i.e. a localization band. For the multi-scale coupling, special scale transition relations are established to handle the underlying material response of both the bulk and the localization zone. At a macroscopic (integration) point, the macroscale displacement jump and the deformation of the surrounding continuum material are used to formulate kinematical boundary constraints for the microscale MVE problem. Upon proper averaging of the MVE response, the macroscopic generalized stress is obtained. Simultaneously, a microscale effective displacement jump is recovered and returned to the macrolevel, based on the MVE deformation field. The equality of the macro- and effective microscale displacement jumps is enforced at the macroscale by Lagrange multipliers, being cohesive tractions at the interface. The applicability of the developed continuous–discontinuous computational homogenization framework is illustrated on two simple benchmark problems involving evolving macroscale discontinuities as a result of microstructural degradation by void growth.},

	abstract = {Structured and layered thin sheets are used in a variety of innovative applications, e.g. flexible displays, rollable solar cells or flexible electronics. Stacks of different materials, with often highly complex interconnects between layers, are thereby used, which are typically loaded in bending combined with intrinsic thermo-mechanical mismatches. As a result, different failure mechanisms at the level of the layered substructure occur, which constitutes a serious reliability concern. This paper deals with the two-scale homogenization of structured thin sheets, whereby a higher-order through-thickness representative volume element (RVE) is used. The methodology relies on the computational homogenization of the mechanics of microstructures, for which first-order and second-order solution strategies have been developed in the past decade. The upscaling of the deformation of structured thin sheets towards a shell-type continuum is second-order in nature. The higher-order kinematics is defined on the basis of a microstructural RVE, which represents the full thickness of the macroscopic structure and a periodic in-plane cell (e.g. a single pixel in a flexible display). The elaboration of the boundary conditions and the solution of the micro-scale boundary value problem are discussed. The obtained micro-scale stress state is homogenized towards a 3D macroscopic shell structure, for which detailed aspects will be emphasized. The coupled numerical solution strategy is briefly outlined. Finally, an example is given and the application to a number of practical problems is highlighted, where the solution provides direct information on each scale. The incorporation of failure events at the substructure level is thereby naturally at hand. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This transient scheme is an extension of the classical (first-order) computational homogenization framework. It is based on an enriched description of the micro–macro kinematics by allowing large spatial fluctuations of the microscopic displacement field in contrast to the macroscopic displacement field, as a result of possible transient phenomena. From the microstructural analysis, the macroscopic stress and the macroscopic linear momentum are obtained from an extended Hill–Mandel macrohomogeneity condition. In particular, the full balance of linear momentum is solved at both scales. Consistent time discretization towards the numerical implementation of the framework as well as a condensed formulation for linear elasticity are provided to ensure a more efficient calculation of the effective response. As an example, the transient computational homogenization approach is applied to the multi-scale analysis of a metamaterial subjected to dynamic uniaxial loading. Consistency of the framework with respect to Direct Numerical Simulations is shown for a large range of loading frequencies and microstructural sizes. Attenuation of the macroscopic waves at specific loading frequencies as well as size effects are highlighted.},

The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites.},

Alternative semi-iterative solution procedures for the case when auxiliary coarse grid is not available, are also developed.

	abstract = {We present a method for the computation of upper and lower bounds for linear-functional outputs of the exact solutions to the two dimensional elasticity equations. The method can be regarded as a generalization of the well known complementary energy principle. The desired output is cast as the supremum of a quadratic-linear convex functional over an infinite dimensional domain. Using duality the computation of an upper bound for the output of interest is reduced to a feasibility problem for the complementary, or dual, problem. In order to make the problem tractable from a computational perspective two additional relaxations that preserve the bounding properties are introduced. First, the domain is triangulated and a domain decomposition strategy is used to generate a sequence of independent problems to be solved over each triangle. The Lagrange multipliers enforcing continuity are approximated using piecewise linear functions over the edges of the triangulation. Second, the solution of the adjoint problem is approximated over the triangulation using a standard Galerkin finite element approach. A lower bound for the output of interest is computed by repeating the process for the negative of the output. Reversing the sign of the computed upper bound for the negative of the output yields a lower bound for the actual output. The method can be easily generalized to three dimensions. However, a constructive proof for the existence of feasible solutions for the outputs of interest is only given in two dimensions. The computed bound gaps are found to converge optimally, that is, at the same rate as the finite element approximation. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that it allows for a data set to be generated that can be used to certify and document the computed bounds. Using this data set and a simple algorithm, the correctness of the computed bounds can be established without recourse to the original code used to compute them. In the present paper, only computational domains whose boundary is made up of straight sided segments and polynomially varying loads are considered. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

A representative volume element (RVE) with piecewise linear Dirichlet boundary conditions, is analyzed using a recently proposed technique for the calibration of constitutive models. The strategy is based on an optimization problem expressed such that the state equation is incorporated via an additional costate field, which has the distinct advantage that error control in an arbitrary “goal” quantity is formally straightforward. The practical solution of the optimization problem is essentially based on Newton's method, which is feasible since it is possible to decompose each Newton step in a number of linear problems using the conventional finite element structure for the RVE problem. The same problem character is pertinent to the solution of the dual problem for a given choice of error measure, which is the key ingredient in the a posteriori error computation. The numerical results show the effectivity of the error prediction for the special case when the material parameters are constant within the subdomains of mesostructural constituents.},

The distinguishing characteristic of the proposed constitutive updates is that, by construction, the corresponding incremental stress—strain relations derive from a pseudo-elastic strain-energy density. This, in turn, confers the incremental boundary value problem a variational structure. In particular, the incremental deformation mapping follows from a minimum principle. This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption. The accuracy and robustness of the variational constitutive updates is demonstrated with the aid of convergence tests involving the finitely-deforming Mises solid and ductile single crystals. The ability of the updates to resolve the complex patterns of slip activity which arise in the latter application is particularly noteworthy.},

In this paper we focus on the Representative Volume Element (RVE) that is commonly taken for granted in most of deterministic as well as in stochastic solid mechanics, although in the latter case it is called the Statistical Volume Element (SVE). The key issue is the scale over which homogenization is being carried out—it is called the mesoscale, separating the microscale (level of microheterogeneities) from the macroscale (level of RVE). As the mesoscale grows, the SVE tends to become the RVE. This occurs in terms of two hierarchies of bounds stemming from Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems on the mesoscale, respectively. Since generally there is no periodicity in real random media, the RVE can only be approached approximately on finite scales.

The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail. A nested finite element solution procedure is outlined, and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some illustrative example problems.},

We derive space-time FE-methods based on the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin method in time for the energy equation. This formulation integrates the stored energy exactly for a given heat flux. When macro-segregation is incorporated into the model, the problem can be formulated in such a way that the phase-transition drives a flow of species. In addition, diffusion is possible throughout the domain. The model can be further rewritten using a potential approach. By this approach for modelling macro-segregation, we are able to obtain discretizations that guarantee that the balance equations are satisfied, and it is possible to solve the phase-transition problem either as a field problem or as a local problem (defined by a local evolution rule).},

In this contribution, we discuss a posteriori error control of the material forces as part of an adaptive strategy to reduce the discretization error to an acceptable level. The data of the dual problem involves the quite non-conventional tangent stiffness of the (material) Eshelby stress tensor with respect to a variation of the (physical) strain field. The suggested strategy is applied to the common fracture mechanics problem of a single-edged crack, whereby different strategies for computing the J-integral are compared.

All microstructures generated by the algorithm are in static and configurational equilibrium. Owing to the continuity constraint imposed upon the microstructural evolution, the predicted material behavior may be path-dependent and exhibit hysteresis. In cases in which there is a strict separation of micro- and macrostructural lengthscales, the proposed relaxation algorithm may effectively be integrated into macroscopic finite-element calculations at the sub-grid level.

	abstract = {Structural lattice models incorporating trusses and beams are frequently used to mechanically model fibrous materials, because they can capture (local) mesoscale phenomena. Physically relevant lattice computations are however computationally expensive. A suitable multiscale approach to reduce the computational cost of large-scale lattice computations is the quasicontinuum (QC) method. This method resolves local mesoscale phenomena in regions of interest and coarse grains elsewhere, using only the lattice model. In previous work, a virtual-power-based QC framework is proposed for lattice models that include local dissipative mechanisms. In this paper, the virtual-power-based QC method is adopted for lattice models in which bond failure and subsequent frictional fiber sliding are incorporated – which are of significant importance for fibrous materials such as paper, cardboard, textile and electronic textile. Bond failure and fiber sliding are nonlocal dissipative mechanisms and to deal with this nonlocality, the virtual-power-based QC method is equipped with a mixed formulation in which the kinematic variables as well as the internal history variables are interpolated. Previously defined summation rules can still be used to sample the governing equations in this QC framework. Illustrative examples are presented.},

	abstract = {This thesis deals with the modeling and simulation of the influence of the material substructure on the macroscopic mechanical properties of duplex stainless steel (DSS). Two subscale levels and their interaction are considered: Grain structure (mesoscale) and crystallographic structure (microscale). Typical mesoscale parameters are the volume fraction, morphology and material properties of the two phases (ferrite and austenite). A multiscale modeling approach is adopted, whereby it is assumed that the macro- and mesoscales are separated such that it is possible to model the subscale effects within a representative volume element (RVE) and to obtain the macroscale response via volume averaging (computational homogenization). A new microscale material model based on crystal (visco)plasticity and damage has been developed as part of the thesis work. This model is used to study the evolution of damage within the grain structure of the RVE. The important issue of parameter identification of the material parameters in the crystal plasticity model is also considered. Specifically, the necessary macroscale experiments needed for obtaining a unique set of material parameter values is exploited. Finally, concurrent (FE\${\textasciicircum}2\$) multiscale modeling simulations are performed. Different types of plane stress conditions in 2D simulations and the computation of the corresponding macroscale algorithmic tangent stiffness (ATS) tensor are discussed. The concurrent simulations are used for investigating the influence of cold–working on the macroscale mechanical properties for a thin metal sheet with strongly inhomogeneous deformation and stress states.},

In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE). This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill-Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects.},

The J-integral provides a criterion for crack propagation of a pre-existing crack. Therefore, its reliable and accurate evaluation is of considerable importance in engineering applications to prevent failure of structures. This can be achieved by goal-oriented adaptive finite element methods based on the well-established strategy of solving an auxiliary dual problem in order to control the error of a (non)linear functional, here the J-integral. In this paper, two principally different goal-oriented adaptive strategies are presented. The first strategy rests upon equilibrated residual error estimators based on local Neumann problems, whereas the second one makes use of averaging techniques. The paper is concluded by a numerical example that illustrates our theoretical results.},

The second related important matter is which physical/mathematical models—including various boundary layers and other disturbances—and which accuracy of the finite element solutions in which norm are prescribed and necessary for the safety and reliability of a certain engineering problem, e.g. in structural engineering, of course depending on materials, systems and the type as well as the magnitude of prescribed loadings (i.e. actions in a factorized concept) acting on a specific structure. It is hard to understand why the current regulations for structural engineering design in Europe—especially the European Standards (Eurocodes) and the relevant German DIN-Codes (DIN: Deutsches Institut für Normung e. V.)—do not lay out any rules or bounds for the prescribed accuracy of the material and structural resistance, i.e. the validity of mechanical modelling and the accuracy of associated numerical methods, usually today the finite element method. It can be observed that behind the existing codes there still lies the old thinking of, e.g., classical elastic beam theory of so-called second order for stability problems and the corresponding elastic potential for plates and shells in buckling. Modern flexible finite element modelling by deriving theories in variational form for thin-walled beams, plates and shells from rather general 3D theories, for both linear and non-linear problems, capturing inelastic deformations and layer effects by material and dimensional expansions are not addressed in the Eurocodes for structural engineering. The necessary consequence is that joint work of computational mechanics specialists and structural engineers, working in national and international code-committees, is absolutely necessary, in order to avoid a lot of costly troubles and dangers of today by improving and updating the codes.},

A rational interface theory based on damage development coupled to inelastic slip and dilatation is developed. The theory uses the interface width as a constitutive parameter, which regularizes the theory of LEMAITRE [1992], that is restricted to perfect bond between grain and matrix. In a series of FE-analyses parameter variations were performed: The unit cell size (as compared to the average grain diameter), the grain-matrix area ratio, the interface width and constitutive parameters. It appears that the composite behavior can be designed as brittle or ductile solely depending on the strength and rate of damage development in the interfaces.

	abstract = {Recently a refined approach to error control in finite element (FE) discretisations has been proposed, Becker and Rannacher (1995b), (1996), which uses weighted a posteriori error estimates derived via duality arguments. The conventional strategies for mesh refinement in FE models of problems from elasticity theory are mostly based on a posteriori error estimates in the energy norm. Such estimates reflect the approximation properties of the finite element ansatz by local interpolation constants while the stability properties of the continuous model enter through a global coercivity constant. However, meshes generated on the basis of such global error estimates are not appropriate in cases where the domain consists of very heterogeneous materials and for the computation of local quantities, e.g., point values or contour integrals. This deficiency is cured by using certain local norms of the dual solution directly as weights multiplying the local residuals of the computed solution. In general, these weights have to be evaluated numerically in the course of the refinement process, yielding almost optimal meshes for various kinds of error measures. This feed-back approach is developed here for primal as well as mixed FE discretisations of the fundamental problem in linear elasticity.},

	abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

Based on an appropriate dual problem, we compute a posteriori the discretization error contributions from approximations of the parameter, state and costate fields in space–time for an arbitrarily chosen goal-oriented error measure of engineering significance. Such a measure can be used in an adaptive strategy (not discussed in this paper) to meet a predefined error tolerance. An important observation is that the Jacobian matrix associated with the resulting Newton method is used (in principle) in solving the dual problem. Rather than treating the Jacobian in a monolithic fashion, we utilize a sequential solution strategy, whereby the FE-topology of the discretized state problem is used repeatedly. Moreover, the proposed solution strategy lends itself naturally to the computation of first and second order sensitivities, which are obtained with little extra computational effort. Numerical results are given for the prototype model of confined aquifer flow with spatially non-homogeneous permeability. The efficiency of the optimization strategy and the effectivity of the error computation are assessed.},

	abstract = {In this contribution, methods of computing the macroscopic tangent that is required in multiscale volumetric homogenization problems are investigated. A condensation procedure that employs the tangent information from the microscale finite element analysis is derived within a special framework where deformation controlled boundary conditions in micromechanical testing are enforced via the penalty method. The developed methodology is demonstrated by sample macroscale problems in the context of the multilevel finite element strategy. Due to the high memory allocation costs that the condensation procedure induces, a perturbation procedure is developed based on a minimal number of micromechanical tests. Results from the condensation and perturbation procedures are compared for sample infinitesimal and finite deformation inelasticity problems and the algorithmic consistency of the macroscopic tangent with the evolution of the macroscopic stress is discussed. It is shown that the ability to compute the macroscopic tangent can also be employed to construct a stress controlled micromechanical testing procedure.},

	abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the development of three-dimensional ﬁnite element formulations suitable for the analysis of material failure at ﬁnite strains. Focus is on the simulation of complex failure patterns. For that purpose, a cohesive-type constitutive model is adopted and further elaborated. More precisely, a traction-separation law connecting the stress vector acting at a certain surface to a displacement jump such as a crack opening displacement is considered. A numerically eﬃcient implementation of this non-standard model is one of the ultimate goals of the present thesis. The advocated ﬁnite element formulation allows for a broad range of diﬀerent constitutive models. Furthermore, no restrictions regarding the space of the continuous displacement approximations are required, i.e., higher-order polynomials can be applied as well. For estimating the quality of the numerical solution a novel class of adaptive methods is presented in the second part of the thesis. Assuming the considered mechanical problem is driven by a variational principle such as energy minimization, so-called variational adaptive ﬁnite element formulations are developed. Within those methods, the state variables and the deformation mapping as well as an improved discretization are computed from the same overriding principle. The performance of those variational mesh adaptions is illustrated by means of two prototypes: variational r-adaptivity and variational h-adaptivity. Finally, the coupling of cohesive ﬁnite element formulations and variational mesh adaption is brieﬂy discussed.},

Disturbances near supports and free edges, in the vicinity of concentrated loads and at thickness jumps cannot be described in a sufficient way by 1D- and 2D-BVPs. In these disturbed subdomains dimensional (d)-adaptivity and model (m)-adaptivity have to be performed coupled with h- and/or p-adaptivity using hierarchically expanded test spaces in order to guarantee reliable and efficient overall results. The expansion strategy is applied for enhancing the spatial dimension and the model which is more efficient and evident for engineers than the reduction method. Using local residual error estimators of the primal problem in the energy norm by solving Dirichlet-problems on element patches, an efficient integrated adaptive calculation of the discretization—and the dimensional error is possible and reasonable, demonstrated by examples. We also present an error estimator of the dual problem, namely a posterior equilibrium method (PEM) for calculation of the interface tractions on local patches with Neumann boundary conditions, using orthogonality conditions. These tractions are equilibrated with respect to the global equilibrium condition of the stress resultants. An upper bound error estimator based on differences between the new tractions and the discontinuous tractions calculated from the stresses of the current finite element solution. The introduction of new element boundary tractions yields a method which can be regarded as a stepwise hybrid displacement method or as Trefftz method for local Neumann problems of element patches. An important advantage of PEM is the coupled computation of local discretization, dimensional- and model errors by an additive split.},

Instead of trying to build differential systems to establish a stress-strain relation at the macroscale, a finite element computation of the representative volume element is carried out simultaneously. Doing so does not require any constitutive equations to be written at the macroscopic scale: all non-linearities come directly from the microscale.
In this paper, we describe how this method can be used in the context of generalized continua. For such continua, constitutive equations are very difficult to write, and a new set of material is difficult to fit to experimental data. The use of FE2 models bypasses this problem because no analytical equation is needed at the macroscale.
An academic application is presented to show that generalized continua are necessary when the size of the heterogeneities increases, and that FE2 models behave well compared to a reference solution.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a multiscale method based on computational homogenization for simulating the mechanical response of a thin-walled porous structure. Due to the inhomogeneous nature of the porous material in the thickness direction, the length scale of the deformation-field variations in the thickness direction is in the same order of magnitude as in the microstructure. To resolve this issue a higher-order stress-resultant shell formulation (with linear variation of the thickness stretch) based on multiscale homogenization is considered. The microscale is accounted for by calculating the micro-fluctuations from a boundary value problem over the domain of a 3D representative volume element (RVE). The breadth and width of the RVE are determined by the representative microstructure of the porous material, whereas in the thickness direction of the shell the RVE completely resolves the microscopic variation. As a result the macroscopic stress resultants are obtained as volume averages through the entire thickness of the shell. The nested solution scheme is quite computationally demanding and it should only be applied where it is needed. The paper is concluded by a couple of numerical examples that illustrate the method and support the arguments put forward in the paper. Comparison is made to a 2D plane strain reference solution with complete resolution of the microstructure over the domain. Also a 3D case is considered, showing the significance of resolving the microscopic fluctuations.},

Adopting the formalism of standard dissipative solids which allows to describe constitutive models by means of only two potentials being the Helmholtz energy and the yield function (or equivalently, a dissipation functional), finite strain plasticity is recast into an equivalent minimization problem. In contrast to previous models, the presented framework covers isotropic and kinematic hardening as well as isotropic and anisotropic elasticity and yield functions. Based on this approach a novel numerical implementation representing the main contribution of the paper is given. In sharp contrast to by now classical approaches such as the return-mapping algorithm and analogously to the theoretical part, the numerical formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all unknown variables follow naturally from minimizing the energy of the considered system. Consequently, several different numerically efficient and robust optimization schemes can be directly employed for solving the resulting minimization problem. Extending previously published works on variational constitutive updates, the advocated model does not rely on any material symmetry and therefore, it can be applied to a broad range of different plasticity theories. As two examples, an anisotropic Hill-type and a Barlat-type model are implemented. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and the performance of the proposed implementation.},

This approach allows us to compare the material response at different scales. A macroscopic stress–strain curve can be derived from the force–displacement response of the mesh. On the other hand, all the grains having the same crystallographic orientation can be taken in a unique phase, and the average response can be compared with models assuming uniform stresses/strains in each phase. Considering each grain individually allows us to characterise the effect of the surrounding grains. Finally, an analysis of the results inside the grains provides information about the relative contributions of the core of the grain and the grain boundary to the deformation/hardening process. The results obtained at the different scales are compared for various types of geometries, assuming either that the cube is in the material or that one or several faces are free surfaces.},

	abstract = {Composites or multi-phase materials are characterized by a distinct heterogeneous microstructure. The failure modes of these materials are governed by several micromechanical effects like debonding phenomena and matrix cracks. The overall mechanical behavior of composites in the linear as well as the nonlinear regime is not only governed by the material properties of the components and their bonds but also by the material layout. In the present contribution the material structure is resolved and modeled on a small scale allowing to deal with these effects. For the numerical simulation we apply a combination of the extended finite-element method (X-FEM) [N. Moës, J. Dolbow, T. Belytschko, A finite element method for crack growth without remeshing, Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg. 46 (1999) 131–150] and the level set method (LSM) [S. Osher, J. Sethian, Fronts propagating with curvature dependent speed: algorithms based on Hamilton–Jacobi formulations, J. Comput. Phys. 79 (1988) 12–49]. In the X-FEM the finite-element approximation is enriched by appropriate functions through the concept of partition of unity. The geometry of material interfaces and cracks is described by the LSM. The combination of both, X-FEM and LSM, turns out to be very natural since the enrichment can be described and even constructed in terms of level set functions. In order to project the material behavior modeled on a small scale onto the large or structural scale, we employ the variational multiscale method (VMM) [T. Hughes, G. Feijoo, L. Mazzei, J.-B. Quiney, The variational multiscale method – a paradigm for computational mechanics, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 166 (1998) 3–24]. This concept is based on an additive split of the displacement field into large and small scale parts. For an efficient solution of the discrete problem we postulate that the small scale displacements are locally supported; in order to achieve this objective one has to assume appropriate constraint conditions. It can be shown that the applied numerical model allows a considerable flexibility concerning the variation of the material design and consequently of the mechanical behavior of a composite.},

This formulation has two distinct advantages: (1) The sensitivity of parameters with respect to uncertainties in the observed data can be assessed efficiently using a dual method, which compares favorably with the more conventional primal method, and (2) The errors arising from the FE discretization can be computed using the same dual method, which is an additional bonus. In fact, both the sensitivity and the discretization error can be estimated in an arbitrarily chosen “goal quantity” (or quantity of interest).

The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.},

Moreover, the macroscale mesh adaptivity is driven by an estimation of discretization errors, which is an absolutely essential feature.

Instead of trying to build differential systems to establish a stress-strain relation at the macroscale, a finite element computation of the representative volume element is carried out simultaneously. Doing so does not require any constitutive equations to be written at the macroscopic scale: all non-linearities come directly from the microscale.
In this paper, we describe how this method can be used in the context of generalized continua. For such continua, constitutive equations are very difficult to write, and a new set of material is difficult to fit to experimental data. The use of FE2 models bypasses this problem because no analytical equation is needed at the macroscale.
An academic application is presented to show that generalized continua are necessary when the size of the heterogeneities increases, and that FE2 models behave well compared to a reference solution.},

Classical computational homogenization schemes hinge on the separation of scales and the existence of representative volume elements. Due to the accumulation of micro-damage, the microstructural volume elements gradually loose their representative character and evolve towards a unique volume with a developing strain localization band, rendering classical homogenization approaches inapplicable.The assumption that the representative nature of the microstructure along the strain localization band is preserved enables the definition of advance scale transition relations for both imposing the overall macroscale load and coarse graining the cohesive behaviour of the strain localization band. Newly developed strain percolation path aligned boundary conditions have been used for this purpose. It is shown that this enables the development and progressive evolution of a strain localization band with minimal interference of the imposed boundary conditions. In addition to classical homogenization of the stress–strain response, a coarse graining scheme for the effective cohesive behaviour of the strain localization band is proposed. This enables the assessment of the microstructural evolution within the strain localization band and simultaneously provides the effective cohesive response useful for macroscale failure models.},

	abstract = {Multi-scale modeling frequently relies on microstructural representative volume elements (RVEs) on which macroscopic deformation is imposed through kinematical boundary conditions. A particular choice of these boundary conditions may influence the obtained effective properties. For strain localization and damage analyses, the RVE is pushed beyond the limits of its representative character, and the applied boundary conditions have a significant impact on the onset and the type of macroscopic material instability to be predicted. In this article, we propose a new type of boundary conditions for microstructural volume elements, called percolation-path-aligned boundary conditions. Intrinsically, these boundary conditions capture the constraining effect of the material surrounding the RVE upon developing localization bands. The alignment with evolving localization bands allows the highly strained band to cross the RVE and fully develop with minimal interference of the applied boundary conditions. For an illustration of the performance of the newly proposed boundary conditions, macroscopic deformation has been imposed on a voided elasto-plastic RVE using different types of boundary conditions. It is observed that the new RVE boundary conditions provide a good estimate for the effective stiffness, are not susceptible to spurious localization, and permit the development of a full strain localization band up to failure.

	abstract = {Computational homogenization for quasistatic stress problems is considered, whereby the macroscale stress is obtained via averaging on Statistical Volume Elements (SVE:s). The variational “workhorse” for the subscale problem is derived from the presumption of weak micro-periodicity, which was proposed by Larsson et al. (2011). Continuum (visco)plasticity is adopted for the mesoscale constituents, whereby a pseudo-elastic, incremental strain energy serves as the potential for the updated stress in a given time-increment. Strict bounds on the incremental strain energy are derived from imposing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, which are defined as suitable restrictions of the proposed variational format. For this purpose, both the standard situation of complete macroscale strain control and the (less standard) situation of macroscale stress control are considered. Numerical results are obtained from “virtual testing” of SVE:s in terms of mean values and a given confidence interval, and it is shown how these properties converge with respect to the SVE-size for different prescribed macroscale deformation modes and different statistical properties of the random microstructure. In addition, the upper and lower bounds for a sequence of increasing strain levels, for a fixed SVE-size, are used as “data” for the calibration of a macroscopic elastic–plastic constitutive model.},

The mathematical tools for modeling sequentially layered composites are explained. The influence of initial and boundary conditions on the effective properties in nonlinear problems is clarified and the notion of stability by homogenization is analyzed. Multiscale micromechanics methods are outlined and the classical as well as the emerging analytical and computational techniques are presented. Computation of effective static and dynamical properties of materials with linear or nonlinear constitutive equations is closely related to the development of generalized theories such as the strain-gradient mechanics. Selected applications of these techniques are outlined. Moreover, the extension of kinetic techniques in homogenization and the related inverse imaging problem are presented.},

	abstract = {Outside of the classical microstructural detail-free estimates of effective moduli, micromechanical analyses of macroscopically uniform heterogeneous media may be grouped into two categories based on different geometric representations of material microstructure. Analysis of periodic materials is based on the repeating unit cell (RUC) concept and the associated periodic boundary conditions. This contrasts with analysis of statistically homogeneous materials based on the representative volume element (RVE) concept and the associated homogeneous boundary conditions. In this paper, using the above classification framework we provide a critical review of the various micromechanical approaches that had evolved along different paths, and outline recent emerging trends. We begin with the basic framework for the solution of micromechanics problems independent of microstructural representation, and then clarify the often confused RVE and RUC concepts. Next, we describe classical models, including the available RVE-based models, and critically examine their limitations. This is followed by discussion of models based on the concept of microstructural periodicity. In the final part, two recent unit cell-based models, which continue to evolve, are outlined. First, a homogenization technique called finite-volume direct averaging micromechanics theory is presented as a viable and easily implemented alternative to the mainstream finite-element based asymptotic homogenization of unit cells. The recent incorporation of parametric mapping into this approach has made it competitive with the finite-element method. Then, the latest work based on locally-exact solutions of unit cell problems is described. In this approach, the interior unit cell problem is solved exactly using the elasticity approach. The exterior problem is tackled with a new variational principle that successfully overcomes the non-separable nature of the overall unit cell problem.},

	abstract = {The transition from micro- to macro-variables of a representative volume element (RVE) of a finitely deformed aggregate (e.g., a composite or a polycrystal) is explored. A number of exact fundamental results on averaging techniques, valid at finite deformations and rotations of any arbitrary heterogeneous continuum, are obtained. These results depend on the choice of suitable kinematical and dynamical variables. For finite deformations, the deformation gradient and its rate, and the nominal stress and its rate, are optimally suited for the averaging purposes. A set of exact identities is presented in terms of these variables. An exact method for homogenization of an ellipsoidal inclusion in an unbounded finitely deformed homogeneous solid is presented, generalizing Eshelby's method for application to finite deformation problems. In terms of the nominal stress rate and the rate of change of the deformation gradient, measured relative to any arbitrary state, a general phase-transformation problem is considered, and the concepts of eigenvelocity gradient and eigenstress rate are introduced. It is shown that the velocity gradient (and hence the nominal stress rate for rate-independent models) in an ellipsoidal region within an unbounded uniform and uniformly deformed solid, remains uniform when this region undergoes a uniform phase transformation corresponding to a constant eigenvelocity gradient. The generalized Eshelby tensor and its conjugate are defined and used to obtain the field quantities in an ellipsoidal inclusion which is embedded in an unbounded, uniformly deformed medium, leading to exact expressions for the concentration tensors and a set of identities relating these quantities. The Green functions for the rate quantities measured from a finitely deformed state, are formulated, and their properties are discussed. The details for calculating the Green function, Eshelby's tensor and its conjugate, and the concentration tensors, are presented. The relation between strong ellipticity and Green's function is examined in connection with the problem of the possible loss of stability of a uniformly stressed homogeneous solid. Exact values of the average nominal stress rate and the average velocity gradient, taken over an ellipsoidal region in a finitely deformed unbounded homogeneous solid, are obtained when arbitrary (variable) eigenvelocity gradients or eigenstress rates are prescribed in any region within the ellipsoid. It is shown that many results for single- and double-inclusion problems in linear elasticity, also apply to the finite-deformation rate problems, provided suitable kinematical and dynamical variables are used. The problem of the double inclusion is considered and exact expressions are given for the average field quantities, taken over the region between the two ellipsoidal domains, one containing the other, when arbitrary eigenvelocity gradients are prescribed within an arbitrary region contained in the inner ellipsoid. These results are further generalized to obtain exact expressions for the average field quantities taken over each annulus of a nested sequence of ellipsoidal regions within a finitely (uniformly) deformed infinite solid, where a constant distinct eigenvelocity gradient is prescribed on each annulus. These results are new, and should provide effective tools for homogenization of multi-component composites at finite deformations and rotations.},

	abstract = {A gradient-enhanced computational homogenization procedure, that allows for the modelling of microstructural size effects, is proposed within a general non-linear framework. In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE). This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill–Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates algorithms for the computation of homogenized stresses and overall tangent moduli of microstructures undergoing large-strain deformations. Typically, these micro-structures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized micro-structures without focussing on details of specific discretization techniques for space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of overall properties of discretized micro-structures which are motivated by a minimization of averaged incremental energy. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical micro-structure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear deformation, (ii) unifrm tractions and (iii) periodic deformation and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by Lagrangian multiplier methods, these conditions generate three classes of constrained minimization problems with associated solution algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and overall properties of micro-structures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the micro-structure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems. We demonstrate their performance for some representative model problems including finite elastic-plastic deformations of composites, texture developments in polycrystalline materials and equilibrium states of particle assemblies. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The micromorphic continuum theory is particularly well-suited to account for higher-order and size-dependent effects in the material layer. On considering the height of the material layer, quantities at different scales are related through averaging theorems and the Hill condition. An admissible scale-transition is guaranteed via the adoption of customized boundary conditions, which account for the deformation modes in the interface.

	abstract = {An accurate homogenization method that accounts for large deformations and viscoelastic material behavior on microscopic and macroscopic levels is presented. This method is based on the classical homogenization theory, assuming local spatial periodicity of the microstructure. Consequently, the microstructure is identified by a representative volume element (RVE) with conformity of opposite boundaries at any stage of the deformation process. The local macroscopic stress is obtained by applying the local macroscopic deformation (represented by the deformation tensor) on a unique RVE through imposing appropriate boundary conditions and averaging the resulting RVE stress field. If the assumption of local periodicity of the morphology is valid, this homogenization procedure supplies a consistent objective relationship between the local macroscopic deformation and the microstructural deformation. The homogenization method was implemented in a multi-level finite element program with meshes on macroscopic level (mesh of entire structure) and microscopic level (meshes of RVEs). The performance was successfully verified by the comparison of the deformation of a perforated macroscopic sheet to the response of a homogenized sheet. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates computational procedures for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structures of inelastic constituents undergoing small strains. The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

The extended theory is capable of accurately estimating both the effective inelastic response of a periodic multiphase composite and the local stress and strain fields in the individual phases. The model is presently limited to materials characterized by constituent phases that are continuous in one direction, but arbitrarily distributed within the repeating unit cell which characterizes the material's periodic microstructure. The model's analytical framework is based on the homogenization technique for periodic media, but the method of solution for the local displacement and stress fields borrows concepts previously employed by the authors in constructing the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials, in contrast with the standard finite-element solution method typically used in conjunction with the homogenization technique. The present approach produces a closed-form macroscopic constitutive equation for a periodic multiphase material valid for both uniaxial and multiaxial loading. The model's predictive accuracy in generating both the effective inelastic stress-strain response and the local stress and inelastic strain fields is demonstrated by comparison with the results of an analytical inelastic solution for the axisymmetric and axial shear response of a unidirectional composite based on the concentric cylinder model and with finite-element results for transverse loading. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	doi = {10.1016/j.cma.2009.03.017},
	abstract = {The homogenization of nonlinear heterogeneous materials is much more difficult than the homogenization of linear ones. This is mainly due to the fact that the general form of the homogenized behavior of nonlinear heterogeneous materials is unknown. At the same time, the prevailing numerical methods, such as concurrent methods, require extensive computational efforts. A simple numerical approach is proposed to compute the effective behavior of nonlinearly elastic heterogeneous materials at small strains. The proposed numerical approach comprises three steps. At the first step, a representative volume element (RVE) for a given nonlinear heterogeneous material is defined, and a loading space consisting of all the boundary conditions to be imposed on the RVE is discretized into a sufficiently large number of points called nodes. At the second step, the boundary condition corresponding to each node is prescribed on the surface of the RVE, and the resulting nonlinear boundary value problem, is solved by the finite element method (FEM) so as to determine the effective response of the heterogeneous material to the loading associated to each node of the loading space. At the third step, the nodal effective responses are interpolated via appropriate interpolation functions, so that the effective strain-energy, stress-strain relation and tangent stiffness tensor of the nonlinear heterogeneous material are provided in a numerically explicit way. This leads to a non-concurrent nonlinear multiscale approach to the computation of structures made of nonlinearly heterogeneous materials. The first version of the proposed approach uses multidimensional cubic splines to interpolate effective nodal responses while the second version of the proposed approach takes advantage of an outer product decomposition of multidimensional data into rank-one tensors to interpolate effective nodal responses and avoid high-rank data. These two versions of the proposed approach are applied to a few examples where nonlinear composites whose phases are characterized by the power-law model are involved. The numerical results given by our approach are compared with available analytical estimates, exact results and full FEM or concurrent multilevel FEM solutions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Motivated by previous small-contrast perturbation estimates, this paper proposes a new method for estimating the effective behavior of nonlinear composite materials with arbitrary phase contrast. The key idea is to write down a second-order Taylor expansion for the phase potentials, about appropriately defined phase average strains. The resulting estimates, which are exact to second order in the contrast, involve the “tangent” modulus tensors of the nonlinear phase potentials, and reduce the problem for the nonlinear composite to a linear problem for an anisotropic thermoelastic composite. Making use of a well-known result by Levin for two-phase thermoelastic composites, together with estimates of the Hashin-Shtrikman type for linear elastic composites, explicit results are generated for two-phase nonlinear composites with statistically isotropic particulate microstructures. Like the earlier small-contrast asymptotic results, the new estimates are found to depend on the determinant of the strain, but unlike the small-contrast results that diverge for shear loading conditions in the nonhardening limit, the new estimates remain bounded and reduce to the classical lower bound in this limiting case. The general method is applied to composites with power-law constitutive behavior and the results are compared with available bounds and numerical estimates, as well as with other nonlinear homogenization procedures. For the cases considered, the new estimates are found to satisfy the restrictions imposed by the bounds, to improve on the predictions of prior homogenization procedures and to be in excellent agreement with the results of the numerical simulations.},

Analysis is made for a composite material whose constituents reveal elastoplasticity character as well as finite deformation in which a local periodicity can be assumed. The updating scheme also enables us to utilize the microscopic stress field, which is obtained in a localization process, to judge, for example, plastic failure. Several computational features in the incremental solution method are investigated to examine the feasibility of the nonlinear homogenization method in practical applications. Numerical examples verify the formulation and provide some insight into practical applications. Some brief remarks are made on large deformation of a periodic unit cell and on computing costs in global-local simultaneous computations. The expensive cost in the computation requires us to propose a new approach to large scale problems.
