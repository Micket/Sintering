A constitutive model for compaction and tensile fracture has been implemented in the explicit FE programme LS-DYNA2D, and it has been tuned to experiments of hydrostatic compression, uniaxial strain and conventional triaxial compression. The programme simulates the complete compaction cycle in a robust manner. Friction against the tooling is properly taken into account. We have further developed a constitutive model for the stress-free solid-state sintering to also account for a mechanical stress field. The sintering model is based on physical concepts, diffusion parameters, free surface energy, dimensions of carbide grains, etc. of the constituents, and was tuned to successfully simulate the unloaded and loaded sintering of simple specimens. The models of compaction and sintering have a common set of state variables, such that after the compaction cycle, and at raising the temperature the sintering starts out with proper account of the residual stress field. Finally, the potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating the production cycle of a simple WC-Co tool piece until sintering to 75\% of full density. The final geometrical shape of the specimen is compared to experimental data.},

A KMC model is presented to simulate microstructural evolution during sintering of complex microstructures taking into consideration grain growth, pore migration, and densification. The results of these simulations are used to generate sintering stress and normalized bulk viscosity for use in continuum level simulation of sintering. The advantage of these simulations is that they can be employed to generate more accurate constitutive parameters based on most general assumptions regarding mesostructure geometry and transport mechanisms of sintering. These constitutive parameters are used as input data for the continuum simulation of the sintering of powder bilayers. Two types of bilayered structures are considered: layers of the same particle material but with different initial porosity, and layers of two different materials.

Second, closed-form similarity solutions are derived, which are exact for short times in the limiting cases of small and large δDs/δDb ratios. Third, approximate analytical solutions are developed based on a thermodynamic variational principle. The latter method is probably the most versatile on e, since its results are formulated as coupled evolution equations for the neck size and the center-to-center approach of the spheres. As such they are well suited to deal with variable stress and temperature histories as encountered by the material during inhomogeneous sintering. Where the similarity solutions are valid (zero stress, short times, small or large δDs/δDb), they confirm the results of the approximate method. Compared to the fully numerical method the approximate method usually works well, also for complex stress histories, but has its limitations when the stress becomes tensile and the neck shrinks rapidly in a crack-like mode.},

The theory to describe the complex thermodynamical behavior of such saturated porous solids has come to certain well-founded conclusions only recently. It is the goal of this paper to show the historical development of the porous media theory, which already started in the eighteenth century, formed in some areas by polemic disputes and tragic events in the lifes of the scientists involved. Furthermore, the current state of the research into this subject is discussed, whereby the state of the development of the material independent basic equations and the constitutive theory is illustrated.

To characterize the creep law, the macroscopic strain rate in the powder aggregate is specified and the energy dissipated in mass transport and interparticle shear is computed. This work rate is used in a potential to determine the macroscopic creep parameters. The effective macroscopic shear and bulk viscosities resulting from this model depend on the relative density of the powder and disappear at random close packed density.

The anisotropic mechanical behavior of powder system is analyzed by considering the behavior of interparticle force and fabric which is represented by the distribution of contact normals. The proposed model is used to determine the dependence of the overall volume change on such factors as local liquid volume, uniformity of liquid distribution, contact angle, initial particle distance, initial confining pressure, particle size and viscosity. The numerical and theoretical analyses in this paper indicate that small particle size, small contact angle, low viscosity, even distribution of liquid phase and loose green powder mass enhance the amount of volume change in the initial stage of LPS. It is also found that a higher confining pressure increases the densification rate but it lowers the amount of net volume shrinkage at the end of the initial stage. The anisotropic behavior of the sample is analyzed by studying the interparticle force change and fabric change during the sintering.},

The contribution of this paper is to combine a descriptive representation of the linear viscoelasticity law for the organic solid matrix with an efficient numerical treatment of the strongly coupled solid-fluid problem. Furthermore, deformation-dependent permeability effects are considered. Within the finite element method (FEM), the weak forms of the governing model equations are set up in a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) in time. Thus, appropriate embedded error-controlled time integration methods can be applied that allow for a reliable and efficient numerical treatment of complex initial boundary-value problems.

In general, natural and industrial processes in which surface tension force is dominant are of dynamic nature. In this second part of this work, the dynamic effects will be included in the finite element model described in Part I. A fully Lagrangian finite element method is used to solve the free surface flow problem and Newtonian constitutive equations describing the fluid behaviour are approximated over a finite time interval. As a result the momentum equations are function of nodal position instead of velocities. The resulting ordinary differential equation is integrated using Newmark algorithm. To avoid overly distorted elements an adaptive remeshing strategy is adopted. The adaptive strategy employs a remeshing indicator based on viscous dissipation functional and incorporates an appropriate transfer operator. The validation of the model is performed by comparing the finite element solutions to available analytical solutions of a droplet oscillations and experimental results pertaining to stretching of a liquid bridge.},

It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

However, the actual sintering kinetics of particulate bodies are determined not only by the properties of the particles themselves and the nature of their local interaction with each other, but also by macroscopic factors. Among them are externally applied forces, kinematic constraints (e.g. adhesion of the sample's end face and furnace surface), and inhomogeneity of properties in the volume under investigation (e.g. inhomogeneity of initial density distribution created during preliminary forming operations). Insufficient treatment of the questions enumerated above was one of the basic reasons hindering the use of sintering theory. A promising approach is connected with the use of continuum mechanics, which has been successfully applied to the analysis of compaction of porous bodies. This approach is based upon the theories of plastic and nonlinear-viscous deformation of porous bodies. Similar ideas have recently been embodied in a continuum theory of sintering.

	abstract = {A quantitative model for liquid phase sintering is developed based on the following ideas. During heating a liquid phase forms, which is easily mobile, wets the solid particles completely, dissolves solid atoms and provides an easy diffusion path for them. The solid density increases by particle rearrangement and by the flattening of particle contacts. Driving (or retarding) forces result from capillary stresses, from applied mechanical stresses, from the pressure of gas entrapped in closed pores and from differences in chemical potential of the dissolved and precipitated matter. At higher densities the driving force may become very small, since the liquid pressure decreases and a negative contribution from the solid-liquid interface energy increases. At this stage grain coarsening plays an important role for the continued filling of larger and larger pores. The model is applied to describe nonisothermal densification curves measured on Si3N4 for various hold temperatures, axial stresses and green densities. Adjusting a moderate number of parameters all having a physical meaning leads to good agreement between theory and experiment.},

The contact area between individual particles is used to characterize the state of the powder compact. Specific numerical results are presented for linear viscous material properties and are compared with existing models. The choice of unit problems for sintering has been discussed at length and some ambiguities in the traditional method of modeling viscous sintering are pointed out.

Today, finite element (FE) simulations of the compaction process in combination with appropriate material (or constitutive) laws for the powder allow quantitative predictions of the density distribution in the green body as well as the tool loadings. The shape after firing can be predicted by using an appropriate material law for sintering. The sinter distortions are a result of inhomogeneous density distributions in the green body. These distortions can be minimised by optimum press kinematics, and the remainder can be compensated by appropriately shaped punch surfaces. After presenting an overview about the underlying models and simulation methods for compacting and liquid phase sintering the simulation procedure together withthe optimisation technique is demonstrated for a cutting insert made of hard metal powder.

In this study, samples differing in initial porosity were sintered and quenched from various points in a sintering cycle to track the porosity effect on densification and distortion. Sinterability of the compact was defined as the ratio of sintering stress to compact strength to predict the densification and linked with sample composition and porosity.

Surface tension effects are incorporated directly into the momentum equation boundary conditions using surface identities that circumvent the need to compute second derivatives of the surface shape, resulting in a robust representation of capillary phenomena. Sample results are shown for the viscous sintering of glassy ceramic particles. The most serious performance issue is error arising from mesh distortion when boundary motion is significant.

Three-dimensional closed pores, however, which predominate during final stage sintering, can separate from migrating grain junctions. The separation process is modelled numerically and the conditions for separation are formulated. Analytical approximations for the pore mobility are shown to describe the numerical results well. They serve to establish effective mobilities of grain boundaries bearing pores in various configurations. Classical theories of grain coarsening are modified by using these effective mobilities. Mechanical constitutive models of sintering contain the grain size as an internal variable.

The major mesostructural constituents are tungsten carbide (WC) particles and large pores, which are embedded in a contiguous cobolt (Co) matrix. A preprocessor code, which is based on Voronoi polygonization, was developed to generate the morphology with prescribed area fraction and size distribution of the constituents. In a continuum model, the ‘driving force’ that brings about the densification is the sintering stress, which is given a rational thermodynamic definition in the paper. This stress represents the boundary loading of a representative volume element (RVE) at free sintering, i.e. in the absence of macroscopic stresses. In such a volume element (or unit cell) the constituents WC and Co are assumed as viscoplastic non-porous solids. A generalized Bingham model (of Norton-type with hardening) seems to be sufficient to represent the creep properties, which are assumed to be of dislocation as well as of diffusion type. The temperature dependence of certain material parameters is discussed. Thermal expansion is accounted for. The developed algorithm was implemented in the commercial FE-code ABAQUS.

The results are considered valid for aggregates with densities ranging from about 60\% to around 90\% of the theoretical fully dense level. The yield surface is obtained from the plastic dissipation at necks between particles given an imposed macroscopically uniform strain rate. The contact yield surface resulting from this analysis is sensitive to pressure as well as to deviatoric stress. The plastic strain rate direction is outwardly normal to the yield surface. Densification takes place when pressure is present, but a notable feature is a vertex on the yield surface at the points of pure positive and negative pressure.

Green compacts were formed using ethylene-bis-stearamide (EBS) as a pore-forming agent with the amount of polymer controlling the initial porosity. Different initial pore sizes were generated by varying the polymer particle size. Dihedral angle was varied by changing the Ni:Cu ratio in the alloys. Finally, the solid:liquid ratio was adjusted via the tungsten content. Dilatometry was employed to measure shrinkage and shrinkage rate during heating. Real time video imaging and quenching experiments isolated the sequence of densification and distortion events in LPS. Distortion was quantified using profiles determined with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) to calculate a distortion parameter. Sintering results showed that at full densification, initial porosity and pore size have no observable effect on distortion for 80W–16Ni–4Cu alloy while distortion reduces with increasing solid volume fraction and dihedral angle.

Particle packings are treated as frameworks of links that connect the centers of particles through inter-particle contacts. The behavior of each link in the framework is based on unit problems for the interaction between individual spheres [Acta metall.36, 2551 (1988)]. This approach bridges the gap between unit models on the level of individual particles and the continuum behavior of very large packings of particles. Furthermore, since the model deals with individual particles, it is possible to predict the evolution of several details of packings that are important to the properties of the deformed part. Using this model the deformation of discrete powder packings under combined sintering and traction-induced compaction may be studied. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental data are presented for the sintering of a two-dimensional packing of mono-sized glass spheres. The model compares well with the experiment and is able to predict several microscopic features of the sintered packing.},

	abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

The governing continuum equations are based on porous media theory applied to an elastic–plastic solid skeleton at small deformations. In the localization analysis, the concept of regularized discontinuity is extensively used at the application to the conservation laws of momentum and mass. As a result, we obtain a coupled localization condition that is preserved also in the numerical formulation. Attention is also given to the design of an overall numerical algorithm to solve the coupled set of non-linear finite-element equations that arise from the element-embedded band approach. In order to arrive at the proper design of the algorithm, we resort to a staggering between the continuous (global) problem and the discontinuous (element) problems. In the numerical examples, the algorithm is shown to be able to capture onset of localization as well as the progressive development of shear bands. In the examples, we study the influence of local and global (boundary) drainage conditions, and the internal friction angle to the failure mechanisms.},

For this purpose a statistics based methodology is proposed as well as a model generation technique which is capable to convert real images taken from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) automatically into a finite element model. Based on this technique, a series of SEM images were studied with the emphasis to investigate the impact of the RVE size on the prediction of the composite behavior in a statistical manner. Furthermore, the paper discusses the impact coming from additional factors, such as boundary conditions and element type. Simulation results based on various case studies are compared with experimental observations and a statistical perspective in RVE size determination is introduced.},

	abstract = {Thermal residual stresses in cemented carbide composites are large, interact with applied stresses, and affect deformation and toughness. Their magnitudes are high (e.g., + 2 GPa for Co and − 0.4 GPa for WC in WC–10 wt.\% Co) and their distributions are complex. Magnitudes depend on expansion coefficients, binder content and particle size; distribution depends on particle angularity — wide ranges of local values occur in both phases. The response of WC-based cemented carbides to applied uniaxial compression and tension is profoundly influenced by thermal residual stresses. They account for long-observed non-linearity at very low strains, plasticity-induced relaxation, unusual Poisson's ratio behavior, and changes in density with loading. Mechanical response is also asymmetric and a function of load direction and history. The response to cyclic loading gives insight into the role of thermal residual stresses in the toughness of these materials, known for their high toughness considering their high hardness.

Results for WC–Co and WC–Ni systems are presented. These studies substantially depend on the application of neutron diffraction: neutrons facilitate good bulk sampling of the volumetric thermal residual stresses in the presence of heavy elements and the use of in situ measurements; diffraction enables each phase to be monitored independently.

Results show a complex plasticity behavior that comprises a primary source of toughening characteristic in cemented carbides. However, it is now clear that assumptions implicit in the application of fracture mechanics to cemented carbides, including far-field linear elasticity and isotropy are not valid. The emergent view of cemented carbide mechanics seems to require a new, non-linear-elastic model of toughness behavior in these materials, both in terms of bulk “continuum” response and response in the presence of defects. Moreover, such models, if they are to provide accuracy, must also take into account the documented anisotropic relaxation and plasticity effects and their sensitivity to load directionality and history.},

	abstract = {WC/Co is an important technical material used in a wide range of industrial applications such as cutting tools, drilling bits and drawing dies due to its excellent combination of wear resistance, strength and toughness.

The focus of this study is the numerical study of the microscale fatigue crack propagation in WC/Co. In this respect, a damage model based on a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approach was implemented in the commercial FEM solver Abaqus/Explicit for simulating the crack propagation in the material. Separate damage laws based on brittle failure and accumulated plasticity driven fatigue are implemented for the WC and the Co phases, respectively.

The material parameters for the carbides are taken from literature. On the other hand, to obtain the material parameters for the binder, a particular model alloy has been developed representing the composition of the binder. Experimental tests carried out with this binder alloy have been used to identify parameters for the appropriate plasticity and damage models.

In order to evaluate the performance of the approach, a numerical model based on an experimental case was generated. The numerical model reflected strong agreement in comparison with the real crack pattern generated during the experiment. Moreover, results of this study indicate a strong dependence of the fatigue crack propagation on accumulated plasticity within the binder phase; this effect suggests a novel understanding of the fatigue mechanism of this material and provides a basis for microstructural simulation.},

This was also confirmed with TEM-EDX. SEM studies showed that during plastic deformation the hard phase skeletons in both materials were partly broken up and infiltrated by binder phase. TEM observations showed a considerable deformation of the WC grains and some infiltrated grain boundaries were facetted along low energy planes. In the cermet, no deformation of the hard phase grains could be seen. The plastic deformation at high temperatures observed by three-point bending corresponds to a number of relaxation processes, detected by internal friction, related to grain boundary sliding.

A previously proposed model, based on results for uniaxial compressive loading, explains the observed asymmetric relaxation of the pre-existing thermal residual stress. This model predicts that the sense of the asymmetry would reverse in the case of tensile loading. The main purpose of the present work was to test this prediction. The reversal of signs was observed. The addition of tensile data has enabled the role of thermal residual stress on stress–strain response to be further elucidated. More complex behavior is observed with respect to the response of the variance in residual stresses, as measured by changes in diffraction peak breadths.},

Stress–strain distributions were calculated in plane sections of microstructures mapped by orientation imaging microscopy. An effective fracture energy was set so that the measured strength of each material was reproduced by the simulation. This model was then used to simulate the properties of hypothetical microstructures to investigate the influence of independent variations in microstructural characteristics on strength. The results indicate that composites with minimum contiguity, containing highly angular, and equiaxed carbide grains with a narrow size distribution should have the maximum strength. Of these parameters, contiguity is the most influential.},

The model incorporates observed microstructural geometries, anisotropic thermal and elastic properties, and a fracture criterion that reproduces the strengths of known specimens. The results show that the greatest potential for increasing the strength occurs when the [001] axes of the carbide grains are orientated perpendicular to the sample loading direction. Furthermore, the strength increases in proportion to the degree of texture, and the texture-derived strength enhancement is greater in microstructures with a larger contiguity.},

A parallel analysis of the materials shows that three domains are characterized by similar internal friction peaks. A region characterized by relaxations in Co, a region characterized by relaxations in the ceramics and a high-temperature region characterized by relaxations at grain boundaries are found. Two peaks are located at high temperatures in both materials. The first located at 1420 K in WC–Co and at 1520 K in TiWCN–Co for 1 Hz is attributed to grain boundary sliding. A very broad and high peak estimated for 1 Hz around 1600 K in WC–Co and above 1700 K in TiWCN–Co has only been directly observed in frequency. It is thermally activated and shows a high, apparent activation energy.},

We investigate the mechanical behavior of the two main families of hardmetals: the cemented carbides, constituted of WC–Co, and the cermets made of a combination of TiC–TiN–(Co,Ni). The comparative analysis of internal friction spectra of both hardmetal families as well as the analysis of spectra of the ceramic phases alone (after binder etching) allows associating different relaxation peaks with specific phases or grain boundaries. The mechanical properties of hardmetals are controlled by the binder. Three temperature domains can be defined. Increasing the temperature binder microplasticity occurs first, then binder segregation at the ceramic grain boundaries prepares the way for infiltration and extensive deformation by grain boundary sliding.},
