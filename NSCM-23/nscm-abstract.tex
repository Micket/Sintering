\abstract{%
In this contribution, multiscale modeling of sintering is shown 
The sintered material is assumed to consist of hard particles (WC) with a melted binder (Co).

The sintering phenomenon on the meso scale can be explained by the effect of surface tension on the melted binder and
the homogenized effect of the surface tension is what is called the sintering stress.
From the macroscopic perspective the specimen (green body) shrinks due to this volumetric sintering stress. In the case of inhomogenous
initial density in the green body, this can result in deformed shapes.

%Basis:
%Sintering, sinterin stress, inhomogenuous shrinkage

%To model this with finite elements, computational homogenization has been applied to a representative volume element of the meso scale.
%For the macro scale
%Method:
%Multiscale (FE$^2$, Homogenization)
%Macro scale: deformation.
%Micro scale: Stokes flow, surface tension.

%Examples, 
Examples are shown for a 2D, fully coupled, FE$^2$ problem as a proof of concept.
This is shown for both with and without hard inclusions and a viscous melt subjected to surface tension.
The examples show how inhomogenous initial density will cause the macroscopic body to shear during the sintering process.
On the meso scale, it is shown how particles are merged, driven by the surface tension potential energy.
