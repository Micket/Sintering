@article{Peterson1999,
abstract = {A new method is described for the iterative solution of two-dimensional free-surface problems, with arbitrary initial geometries, in which the interior of the domain is represented by an unstructured, triangular Eulerian mesh and the free surface is represented directly by the piecewise-quadratic edges of the isoparametric quadratic-velocity, linear-pressure Taylor–Hood elements. At each time step, the motion of the free surface is computed explicitly using the current velocity field and, once the new free-surface location has been found, the interior nodes of the mesh are repositioned using a continuous deformation model that preserves the original connectivity. In the event that the interior of the domain must be completely remeshed, a standard Delaunay triangulation algorithm is used, which leaves the initial boundary discretisation unchanged. The algorithm is validated via the benchmark viscous flow problem of the coalescence of two infinite cylinders of equal radius, in which the motion is due entirely to the action of capillary forces on the free surface. This problem has been selected for a variety of reasons: the initial and final (steady state) geometries differ considerably; in the passage from the former to the latter, large free-surface curvatures—requiring accurate modelling—are encountered; an analytical solution is known for the location of the free surface; there exists a large body of literature on alternative numerical simulations. A novel feature of the present work is its geometric generality and robustness; it does not require a priori knowledge of either the evolving domain geometry or the solution contained therein.

abstract = {Common modeling in continuum mechanics takes exclusively the bulk into account, nevertheless, neglecting possible contributions from the boundary. However, boundary effects sometimes play a dominant role in the material behavior, the most prominent example being surface tension. Within this contribution boundary potentials are allowed, in general, to de- pend not only on the boundary deformation but also on the boundary deformation gradient. Motivated by this idea, a suitable finite element framework based on rank deficient deformation gradients is established. In essence, the total potential energy functional that we seek to mini- mize with respect to all admissible spatial variations at fixed material placement is consisting of both contributions from the bulk and the boundary.},

@article{DetPer2006,
abstract = {This work is concerned with the simulation of incompressible Newtonian fluid flow problems with free surfaces in the presence of surface tension. The computational framework presented is based on the stabilised velocity–pressure finite element method. The movement and deformation of the computational domain are accounted for by employing the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) description of the fluid kinematics. The numerical model is extended to incorporate surface tension effects. A novel partitioned solution procedure is developed based on the Newton–Raphson methodology which incorporates full linearisation of the overall incremental problem. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the methodology.},

@article{Steinmann2008:boundaryenergies,
abstract = {This contribution deals with the implications of boundary potential energies, i.e. in short surface, curve and point potentials, on deformational and configurational mechanics. Within the realm of deformational mechanics the surface/curve potentials are allowed in the most general case to depend on the deformation, the surface/curve deformation gradient and the spatial surface normal/curve tangent and are parametrised in the material placement and the material surface normal/curve tangent. The point potentials depend on the deformation and are parametrised in the material placement. From the configurational mechanics perspective the roles of fields and parametrisations are reversed. By considering variational arguments based on the kinematics of deforming surfaces/curves, in particular the relevant surface/curve stresses and distributed forces contributing to (localized) deformational and configurational force balances at surfaces/curves/points, which extend the common traction boundary conditions, are derived. Thereby, dissipative distributed configurational forces that are energetically conjugate to configurational changes are introduced as definitions. The (localized) force balances at surfaces/curves/points together with the contributing stresses and distributed forces within deformational and configurational mechanics display an intriguing duality. The resulting dissipative configurational tractions at the boundary are exemplified for some illustrative cases of boundary potentials.},

@article{JavSte2010:3d,
abstract = {This paper, in line with part I [53], is concerned with the finite element implementation of boundary potential energies and the study of their impact on the deformations of solids thereby the main thrust is the fully three-dimensional formulation and implementation incorporating anisotropic effects. Boundary effects can play a dominant role in the material behavior, the most prominent example being surface tension. However, the common modelling in continuum mechanics takes exclusively the bulk into account, nevertheless, neglecting possible contributions from the boundary. Within this contribution the boundary potentials are allowed, in general, to depend not only on the boundary deformation but also on the boundary deformation gradient and the spatial boundary normal. For the formulation of the finite element method, the concept of convected curvilinear coordinates attached to the boundary is employed and the corresponding derivations completely based on a tensorial representation are carried out. Afterwards, the discretization of the generalized weak formulation, including boundary potentials, is performed and eventually numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the boundary effects due to different proposed material models. In contrast to the previous literature on this topic, the current manuscript covers jointly the following issues related to boundary energies: (1) the formulation and implementation represents a fully three-dimensional framework at large deformations, (2) the formulation of the problem and the proposed material models are based on finite strains, however, it is shown that the linearization would lead to the small strain models proposed previously in the literature and (3) the current manuscript covers the issue of anisotropy effects on the boundary energies which to the best of our knowledge has not been exemplified earlier.},
