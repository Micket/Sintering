abstract = {We have developed a tool for simulating the press cycle and the sintering cycle of cemented carbides. A constitutive model for compaction and tensile fracture has been implemented in the explicit FE programme LS-DYNA2D, and it has been tuned to experiments of hydrostatic compression, uniaxial strain and conventional triaxial compression. The programme simulates the complete compaction cycle in a robust manner. Friction against the tooling is properly taken into account. We have further developed a constitutive model for the stress-free solid-state sintering to also account for a mechanical stress field. The sintering model is based on physical concepts, diffusion parameters, free surface energy, dimensions of carbide grains, etc. of the constituents, and was tuned to successfully simulate the unloaded and loaded sintering of simple specimens. The models of compaction and sintering have a common set of state variables, such that after the compaction cycle, and at raising the temperature the sintering starts out with proper account of the residual stress field. Finally, the potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating the production cycle of a simple WC-Co tool piece until sintering to 75% of full density. The final geometrical shape of the specimen is compared to experimental data.},

@article{Svoetal1996,
abstract = {A quantitative model for liquid phase sintering is developed based on the following ideas. During heating a liquid phase forms, which is easily mobile, wets the solid particles completely, dissolves solid atoms and provides an easy diffusion path for them. The solid density increases by particle rearrangement and by the flattening of particle contacts. Driving (or retarding) forces result from capillary stresses, from applied mechanical stresses, from the pressure of gas entrapped in closed pores and from differences in chemical potential of the dissolved and precipitated matter. At higher densities the driving force may become very small, since the liquid pressure decreases and a negative contribution from the solid-liquid interface energy increases. At this stage grain coarsening plays an important role for the continued filling of larger and larger pores. The model is applied to describe nonisothermal densification curves measured on Si3N4 for various hold temperatures, axial stresses and green densities. Adjusting a moderate number of parameters all having a physical meaning leads to good agreement between theory and experiment.},

@article{XuMeh1997,
abstract = {A constitutive model for powders in the initial rearrangement stage of liquid phase sintering (LPS), where capillary force is the driving force for densification, is developed in this paper. The formulation is based on certain theories in micromechanics of granular materials (see Mehrabadi et al., 1992a; Mehrabadi et al., 1992b; Nemat-Nasser and Mehrabadi, 1983; Nemat-Nasser and Mehrabadi, 1984; Christoffersen et al., 1981). The anisotropic mechanical behavior of powder system is analyzed by considering the behavior of interparticle force and fabric which is represented by the distribution of contact normals. The proposed model is used to determine the dependence of the overall volume change on such factors as local liquid volume, uniformity of liquid distribution, contact angle, initial particle distance, initial confining pressure, particle size and viscosity. The numerical and theoretical analyses in this paper indicate that small particle size, small contact angle, low viscosity, even distribution of liquid phase and loose green powder mass enhance the amount of volume change in the initial stage of LPS. It is also found that a higher confining pressure increases the densification rate but it lowers the amount of net volume shrinkage at the end of the initial stage. The anisotropic behavior of the sample is analyzed by studying the interparticle force change and fabric change during the sintering.},

abstract = {This paper describes variational formulation and finite element discretization of surface tension. The finite element formulation is cast in the Lagrangian framework, which describes explicitly the interface evolution. In this context surface tension formulation emerges naturally through the weak form of the Laplace–Young equation. The constitutive equations describing the behaviour of Newtonian fluids are approximated over a finite time step, leaving the governing equations for the free surface flow function of geometry change rather than velocities. These nonlinear equations are then solved by using Newton-Raphson procedure. Numerical examples have been executed and verified against the solution of the ordinary differential equation resulting from a parameterization of the Laplace-Young equation for equilibrium shapes of drops and liquid bridges under the influence of gravity and for various contact angle boundary conditions.},

abstract = {A parallel, finite element method is presented for the computation of three-dimensional, free-surface flows where surface tension effects are significant. The method employs an unstructured tetrahedral mesh, a front-tracking arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation, and fully implicit time integration. Interior mesh motion is accomplished via pseudo-solid mesh deformation. Surface tension effects are incorporated directly into the momentum equation boundary conditions using surface identities that circumvent the need to compute second derivatives of the surface shape, resulting in a robust representation of capillary phenomena. Sample results are shown for the viscous sintering of glassy ceramic particles. The most serious performance issue is error arising from mesh distortion when boundary motion is significant. This effect can be severe enough to stop the calculations; some simple strategies for improving performance are tested.},

@article{Brackbill1992,
abstract = {A new method for modeling surface tension effects on fluid motion has been developed. Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or “colors,” are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

The contact area between individual particles is used to characterize the state of the powder compact. Specific numerical results are presented for linear viscous material properties and are compared with existing models. The choice of unit problems for sintering has been discussed at length and some ambiguities in the traditional method of modeling viscous sintering are pointed out.

abstract = {Densification and shape distortion are two important events associated with liquid phase sintering. In general, the initial porosity effects on both are ignored due to the rapid densification typical to liquid phase sintering. To completely describe the sintering process, porosity and pore size effects should be included in any sintering model. In this study, samples differing in initial porosity were sintered and quenched from various points in a sintering cycle to track the porosity effect on densification and distortion. Sinterability of the compact was defined as the ratio of sintering stress to compact strength to predict the densification and linked with sample composition and porosity. Porosity influences how the sample distorts during sintering. A high initial porosity sample is more likely to collapse along the longitudinal direction while a low initial porosity sample tends to spheroidize.},

@article{MahRun2000,
abstract = {The mesomechanics approach presented in this paper aims at enhancing the understanding of, as well as providing a predicting capability for, the densification process in cemented carbides due to solid-phase sintering. The major mesostructural constituents are tungsten carbide (WC) particles and large pores, which are embedded in a contiguous cobolt (Co) matrix. A preprocessor code, which is based on Voronoi polygonization, was developed to generate the morphology with prescribed area fraction and size distribution of the constituents. In a continuum model, the ‘driving force’ that brings about the densification is the sintering stress, which is given a rational thermodynamic definition in the paper. This stress represents the boundary loading of a representative volume element (RVE) at free sintering, i.e. in the absence of macroscopic stresses. In such a volume element (or unit cell) the constituents WC and Co are assumed as viscoplastic non-porous solids. A generalized Bingham model (of Norton-type with hardening) seems to be sufficient to represent the creep properties, which are assumed to be of dislocation as well as of diffusion type. The temperature dependence of certain material parameters is discussed. Thermal expansion is accounted for. The developed algorithm was implemented in the commercial FE-code ABAQUS. Finally, the simulation results are compared with experimental results from the sintering of free as well as uniaxially loaded specimens.},

abstract = {Microstructure attributes such as solid volume fraction, dihedral angle, initial porosity, and initial pore size are important to densification and distortion control in liquid phase sintering (LPS). In our experiments, these parameters were varied to measure densification and distortion behavior during LPS using W–Ni–Cu alloys. Green compacts were formed using ethylene-bis-stearamide (EBS) as a pore-forming agent with the amount of polymer controlling the initial porosity. Different initial pore sizes were generated by varying the polymer particle size. Dihedral angle was varied by changing the Ni:Cu ratio in the alloys. Finally, the solid:liquid ratio was adjusted via the tungsten content. Dilatometry was employed to measure shrinkage and shrinkage rate during heating. Real time video imaging and quenching experiments isolated the sequence of densification and distortion events in LPS. Distortion was quantified using profiles determined with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) to calculate a distortion parameter. Sintering results showed that at full densification, initial porosity and pore size have no observable effect on distortion for 80W–16Ni–4Cu alloy while distortion reduces with increasing solid volume fraction and dihedral angle. Microgravity experiments are proposed for further understanding of microstructure effects on densification and distortion in LPS.},

abstract = {A numerical model for the constitutive response of powder compacts during densification is presented. Particle packings are treated as frameworks of links that connect the centers of particles through inter-particle contacts. The behavior of each link in the framework is based on unit problems for the interaction between individual spheres [Acta metall.36, 2551 (1988)]. This approach bridges the gap between unit models on the level of individual particles and the continuum behavior of very large packings of particles. Furthermore, since the model deals with individual particles, it is possible to predict the evolution of several details of packings that are important to the properties of the deformed part. Using this model the deformation of discrete powder packings under combined sintering and traction-induced compaction may be studied. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental data are presented for the sintering of a two-dimensional packing of mono-sized glass spheres. The model compares well with the experiment and is able to predict several microscopic features of the sintered packing.},

The quasi-static analysis is often required to find not only the initial shape of the liquid but also the static equilibrium state of a liquid body before a dynamic analysis can be carried out. In general, natural and industrial processes in which surface tension force is dominant are of dynamic nature. In this second part of this work, the dynamic effects will be included in the finite element model described in Part I. A fully Lagrangian finite element method is used to solve the free surface flow problem and Newtonian constitutive equations describing the fluid behaviour are approximated over a finite time interval. As a result the momentum equations are function of nodal position instead of velocities. The resulting ordinary differential equation is integrated using Newmark algorithm. To avoid overly distorted elements an adaptive remeshing strategy is adopted. The adaptive strategy employs a remeshing indicator based on viscous dissipation functional and incorporates an appropriate transfer operator. The validation of the model is performed by comparing the finite element solutions to available analytical solutions of a droplet oscillations and experimental results pertaining to stretching of a liquid bridge.},

The advantage of these simulations is that they can be employed to generate more accurate constitutive parameters based on most general assumptions regarding mesostructure geometry and transport mechanisms of sintering. These constitutive parameters are used as input data for the continuum simulation of the sintering of powder bilayers. Two types of bilayered structures are considered: layers of the same particle material but with different initial porosity, and layers of two different materials.
