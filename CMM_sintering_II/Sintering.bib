The elastic response is stated in terms of a hyperelastic model based on a hookean elastic free energy. Plastic response is defined in terms of a two parameter yield surface that evolves in terms of the relative density. Two different flow rules are considered and tested in front of some available experimental results. Application to the simulation of an actual powder-metallurgy compaction process is also shown.},

abstract = {A finite-element model is developed and implemented on a massively parallel supercomputer to study the viscous sintering of a three-dimensional (3-D) configuration of three particles. Model development is described, implementation is discussed, and calculations are compared with benchmark results for a two-dimensional (2-D) axisymmetric case. For the first time, detailed simulation results are shown for the viscous sintering of a 3-D, three-particle system. The calculations predict center approach of particle pairs concurrent with asymmetric neck growth, effects which ultimately lead to an inward rotation of the outer particles. Anisotropic shrinkage arises due to this 3-D rearrangement of the particles during sintering.},

abstract = {An integral method is developed to solve the two-dimensional Stokes problem with Neumann boundary conditions for multiply connected domains in which the inside hole area can shrink and disappear. The method is applied to simulate viscous sintering. In particular the sintering of glasses can be modelled as such, i.e. a viscous incompressible Newtonian volume flow driven solely by surface tension. A Boundary Element Method is applied to solve the integral equations of Stokes flow involved, and the time integration is carried out by a variable-step, variable-order Backward Differences Formulae method. The derived numerical algorithm is demonstrated for several arbitrarily shaped multiply connected sintering domains. In particular some cylindrical packings are considered. The latter simulations provide a justification for the use of ‘unit problems’ in the theory of sintering.},

abstract = {A new method for modeling surface tension effects on fluid motion has been developed. Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or “colors,” are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

abstract = {Liquid-phase sintering (LPS) is a technique widely used to sinter hard and heavy metals such as tungsten carbide and tungsten heavy alloys. LPS involves formation of a liquid phase during sintering that promotes fast densification. However, the ratio of liquid to solid, microstructure and external forces (gravity, component/substrate friction) act to promote distortion as a function of sintering time and temperature. To understand and control distortion during LPS, a numerical model is being developed to solve continuity and momentum equations using a finite-element technique. In this article, transient distortion under gravity is calculated as a function of surface tension, density, and viscosity of the material. The effect of the friction force due to the component support during isothermal sintering is also evaluated and compared with experimental data acquired by in-situ recording of distortion during sintering.},

In earlier work, three classes of mechanism were modelled: plastic yielding, power-law creep and diffusional densification. In this paper two further mechanisms are added: the diffusional deformation of the particles themselves when the grain size is much smaller than the particle size, and the separation of pores from boundaries when grain growth occurs. Substantially better agreement between the model and experimental data is now obtained, particularly in cases where grain growth has occurred. Application of HIP diagrams to tool steels, alumina and copper, incorporating experimental data, are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {A macroscopic constitutive law is developed for the plastic yielding of a random aggregate of perfectly plastic spherical metal particles. The particles are bonded perfectly by isolated contacts and deformation occurs by plastic yielding of material at and near these contacts. The configuration is treated as isotropic and homogeneous as far as particle size and properties are concerned. The results are considered valid for aggregates with densities ranging from about 60% to around 90% of the theoretical fully dense level. The yield surface is obtained from the plastic dissipation at necks between particles given an imposed macroscopically uniform strain rate. The contact yield surface resulting from this analysis is sensitive to pressure as well as to deviatoric stress. The plastic strain rate direction is outwardly normal to the yield surface. Densification takes place when pressure is present, but a notable feature is a vertex on the yield surface at the points of pure positive and negative pressure. Consequently, plastic flow in the presence of pure pressure is nonunique, and deviatoric components may be superposed on densification.},

abstract = {The paper presents a framework for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structure, which undergoes non-isothermal inelastic deformations at large strains. The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.},

A constitutive model for compaction and tensile fracture has been implemented in the explicit FE programme LS-DYNA2D, and it has been tuned to experiments of hydrostatic compression, uniaxial strain and conventional triaxial compression. The programme simulates the complete compaction cycle in a robust manner. Friction against the tooling is properly taken into account. We have further developed a constitutive model for the stress-free solid-state sintering to also account for a mechanical stress field. The sintering model is based on physical concepts, diffusion parameters, free surface energy, dimensions of carbide grains, etc. of the constituents, and was tuned to successfully simulate the unloaded and loaded sintering of simple specimens. The models of compaction and sintering have a common set of state variables, such that after the compaction cycle, and at raising the temperature the sintering starts out with proper account of the residual stress field. Finally, the potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating the production cycle of a simple WC-Co tool piece until sintering to 75% of full density. The final geometrical shape of the specimen is compared to experimental data.},

abstract = {Based on the Theory of Porous Media (mixture theories extended by the concept of volume fractions), a model describing the mechanical behavior of hydrated soft tissues such as articular cartilage is presented. As usual, the tissue will be modeled as a materially incompressible binary medium of one linear viscoelastic porous solid skeleton saturated by a single viscous pore-fluid. The contribution of this paper is to combine a descriptive representation of the linear viscoelasticity law for the organic solid matrix with an efficient numerical treatment of the strongly coupled solid-fluid problem. Furthermore, deformation-dependent permeability effects are considered. Within the finite element method (FEM), the weak forms of the governing model equations are set up in a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) in time. Thus, appropriate embedded error-controlled time integration methods can be applied that allow for a reliable and efficient numerical treatment of complex initial boundary-value problems. The applicability and the efficiency of the presented model are demonstrated within canonical, numerical examples, which reveal the influence of the intrinsic dissipation on the general behavior of hydrated soft tissues, exemplarily on articular cartilage.},

abstract = {In Part I, a finite element model of surface tension has been discussed and used to solve some quasi-static problems. The quasi-static analysis is often required to find not only the initial shape of the liquid but also the static equilibrium state of a liquid body before a dynamic analysis can be carried out. In general, natural and industrial processes in which surface tension force is dominant are of dynamic nature. In this second part of this work, the dynamic effects will be included in the finite element model described in Part I. A fully Lagrangian finite element method is used to solve the free surface flow problem and Newtonian constitutive equations describing the fluid behaviour are approximated over a finite time interval. As a result the momentum equations are function of nodal position instead of velocities. The resulting ordinary differential equation is integrated using Newmark algorithm. To avoid overly distorted elements an adaptive remeshing strategy is adopted. The adaptive strategy employs a remeshing indicator based on viscous dissipation functional and incorporates an appropriate transfer operator. The validation of the model is performed by comparing the finite element solutions to available analytical solutions of a droplet oscillations and experimental results pertaining to stretching of a liquid bridge.},

abstract = {Microstructure attributes such as solid volume fraction, dihedral angle, initial porosity, and initial pore size are important to densification and distortion control in liquid phase sintering (LPS). In our experiments, these parameters were varied to measure densification and distortion behavior during LPS using W–Ni–Cu alloys. Green compacts were formed using ethylene-bis-stearamide (EBS) as a pore-forming agent with the amount of polymer controlling the initial porosity. Different initial pore sizes were generated by varying the polymer particle size. Dihedral angle was varied by changing the Ni:Cu ratio in the alloys. Finally, the solid:liquid ratio was adjusted via the tungsten content. Dilatometry was employed to measure shrinkage and shrinkage rate during heating. Real time video imaging and quenching experiments isolated the sequence of densification and distortion events in LPS. Distortion was quantified using profiles determined with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) to calculate a distortion parameter. Sintering results showed that at full densification, initial porosity and pore size have no observable effect on distortion for 80W–16Ni–4Cu alloy while distortion reduces with increasing solid volume fraction and dihedral angle. Microgravity experiments are proposed for further understanding of microstructure effects on densification and distortion in LPS.},

abstract = {The paper investigates algorithms for the computation of homogenized stresses and overall tangent moduli of microstructures undergoing small strains. Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems. We demonstrate their performance for some representative model problems including elastic–plastic deformations of composite materials.},

abstract = {A quantitative model for liquid phase sintering is developed based on the following ideas. During heating a liquid phase forms, which is easily mobile, wets the solid particles completely, dissolves solid atoms and provides an easy diffusion path for them. The solid density increases by particle rearrangement and by the flattening of particle contacts. Driving (or retarding) forces result from capillary stresses, from applied mechanical stresses, from the pressure of gas entrapped in closed pores and from differences in chemical potential of the dissolved and precipitated matter. At higher densities the driving force may become very small, since the liquid pressure decreases and a negative contribution from the solid-liquid interface energy increases. At this stage grain coarsening plays an important role for the continued filling of larger and larger pores. The model is applied to describe nonisothermal densification curves measured on Si3N4 for various hold temperatures, axial stresses and green densities. Adjusting a moderate number of parameters all having a physical meaning leads to good agreement between theory and experiment.},

The governing continuum equations are based on porous media theory applied to an elastic–plastic solid skeleton at small deformations. In the localization analysis, the concept of regularized discontinuity is extensively used at the application to the conservation laws of momentum and mass. As a result, we obtain a coupled localization condition that is preserved also in the numerical formulation. Attention is also given to the design of an overall numerical algorithm to solve the coupled set of non-linear finite-element equations that arise from the element-embedded band approach. In order to arrive at the proper design of the algorithm, we resort to a staggering between the continuous (global) problem and the discontinuous (element) problems. In the numerical examples, the algorithm is shown to be able to capture onset of localization as well as the progressive development of shear bands. In the examples, we study the influence of local and global (boundary) drainage conditions, and the internal friction angle to the failure mechanisms.},

Although porous media are of considerable practical significance the description of their mechanical and thermodynamical behavior has been unsatisfactory for a long time. The theory to describe the complex thermodynamical behavior of such saturated porous solids has come to certain well-founded conclusions only recently. It is the goal of this paper to show the historical development of the porous media theory, which already started in the eighteenth century, formed in some areas by polemic disputes and tragic events in the lifes of the scientists involved. Furthermore, the current state of the research into this subject is discussed, whereby the state of the development of the material independent basic equations and the constitutive theory is illustrated. For a certain class of models general theorems, such as minimum and maximum problems, are derived and the uniqueness of solutions of boundary value problems is proved.},

abstract = {A parallel, finite element method is presented for the computation of three-dimensional, free-surface flows where surface tension effects are significant. The method employs an unstructured tetrahedral mesh, a front-tracking arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation, and fully implicit time integration. Interior mesh motion is accomplished via pseudo-solid mesh deformation. Surface tension effects are incorporated directly into the momentum equation boundary conditions using surface identities that circumvent the need to compute second derivatives of the surface shape, resulting in a robust representation of capillary phenomena. Sample results are shown for the viscous sintering of glassy ceramic particles. The most serious performance issue is error arising from mesh distortion when boundary motion is significant. This effect can be severe enough to stop the calculations; some simple strategies for improving performance are tested.},

abstract = {A gradient-enhanced computational homogenization procedure, that allows for the modelling of microstructural size effects, is proposed within a general non-linear framework. In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE). This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill-Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects.},

This stress can be described as an equilibrium or sintering stress that is, as defined here, the stress that must be applied to prevent spontaneous shrinkage of a sinter body. An expression that quantifies the sintering stress is developed and is assumed to be dependent upon two microstructural parameters: the specific surface area and the mean curvature of the void-solid interface.

As usual, the tissue will be modeled as a materially incompressible binary medium of one linear viscoelastic porous solid skeleton saturated by a single viscous pore-fluid. The contribution of this paper is to combine a descriptive representation of the linear viscoelasticity law for the organic solid matrix with an efficient numerical treatment of the strongly coupled solid-fluid problem. Furthermore, deformation-dependent permeability effects are considered. Within the finite element method (FEM), the weak forms of the governing model equations are set up in a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) in time. Thus, appropriate embedded error-controlled time integration methods can be applied that allow for a reliable and efficient numerical treatment of complex initial boundary-value problems. The applicability and the efficiency of the presented model are demonstrated within canonical, numerical examples, which reveal the influence of the intrinsic dissipation on the general behavior of hydrated soft tissues, exemplarily on articular cartilage.},

In general, the initial porosity effects on both are ignored due to the rapid densification typical to liquid phase sintering. To completely describe the sintering process, porosity and pore size effects should be included in any sintering model. In this study, samples differing in initial porosity were sintered and quenched from various points in a sintering cycle to track the porosity effect on densification and distortion. Sinterability of the compact was defined as the ratio of sintering stress to compact strength to predict the densification and linked with sample composition and porosity. Porosity influences how the sample distorts during sintering. A high initial porosity sample is more likely to collapse along the longitudinal direction while a low initial porosity sample tends to spheroidize.},

Particle packings are treated as frameworks of links that connect the centers of particles through inter-particle contacts. The behavior of each link in the framework is based on unit problems for the interaction between individual spheres [Acta metall.36, 2551 (1988)]. This approach bridges the gap between unit models on the level of individual particles and the continuum behavior of very large packings of particles. Furthermore, since the model deals with individual particles, it is possible to predict the evolution of several details of packings that are important to the properties of the deformed part. Using this model the deformation of discrete powder packings under combined sintering and traction-induced compaction may be studied. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental data are presented for the sintering of a two-dimensional packing of mono-sized glass spheres. The model compares well with the experiment and is able to predict several microscopic features of the sintered packing.},

The shape after firing can be predicted by using an appropriate material law for sintering. The sinter distortions are a result of inhomogeneous density distributions in the green body. These distortions can be minimised by optimum press kinematics, and the remainder can be compensated by appropriately shaped punch surfaces. After presenting an overview about the underlying models and simulation methods for compacting and liquid phase sintering the simulation procedure together withthe optimisation technique is demonstrated for a cutting insert made of hard metal powder. Finally, the shape predictions of the liquid phase sintering model are compared with a simplified model.},

abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

The anisotropic mechanical behavior of powder system is analyzed by considering the behavior of interparticle force and fabric which is represented by the distribution of contact normals. The proposed model is used to determine the dependence of the overall volume change on such factors as local liquid volume, uniformity of liquid distribution, contact angle, initial particle distance, initial confining pressure, particle size and viscosity. The numerical and theoretical analyses in this paper indicate that small particle size, small contact angle, low viscosity, even distribution of liquid phase and loose green powder mass enhance the amount of volume change in the initial stage of LPS. It is also found that a higher confining pressure increases the densification rate but it lowers the amount of net volume shrinkage at the end of the initial stage. The anisotropic behavior of the sample is analyzed by studying the interparticle force change and fabric change during the sintering.},

abstract = {The mesomechanics approach presented in this paper aims at enhancing the understanding of, as well as providing a predicting capability for, the densification process in cemented carbides due to solid-phase sintering. The major mesostructural constituents are tungsten carbide (WC) particles and large pores, which are embedded in a contiguous cobolt (Co) matrix. A preprocessor code, which is based on Voronoi polygonization, was developed to generate the morphology with prescribed area fraction and size distribution of the constituents. In a continuum model, the ‘driving force’ that brings about the densification is the sintering stress, which is given a rational thermodynamic definition in the paper. This stress represents the boundary loading of a representative volume element (RVE) at free sintering, i.e. in the absence of macroscopic stresses. In such a volume element (or unit cell) the constituents WC and Co are assumed as viscoplastic non-porous solids. A generalized Bingham model (of Norton-type with hardening) seems to be sufficient to represent the creep properties, which are assumed to be of dislocation as well as of diffusion type. The temperature dependence of certain material parameters is discussed. Thermal expansion is accounted for. The developed algorithm was implemented in the commercial FE-code ABAQUS. Finally, the simulation results are compared with experimental results from the sintering of free as well as uniaxially loaded specimens.},

A KMC model is presented to simulate microstructural evolution during sintering of complex microstructures taking into consideration grain growth, pore migration, and densification. The results of these simulations are used to generate sintering stress and normalized bulk viscosity for use in continuum level simulation of sintering. The advantage of these simulations is that they can be employed to generate more accurate constitutive parameters based on most general assumptions regarding mesostructure geometry and transport mechanisms of sintering. These constitutive parameters are used as input data for the continuum simulation of the sintering of powder bilayers. Two types of bilayered structures are considered: layers of the same particle material but with different initial porosity, and layers of two different materials. The simulation results are verified by comparing them with shrinkage and warping during the sintering of bilayer ZnO powder compacts.},
