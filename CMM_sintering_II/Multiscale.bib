abstract = {In this paper we investigate the possibility for, and characteristics of, reliable and efficient a posteriori error computation at the integration of the constitutive relations pertinent to (visco)plasticity with softening/hardening. The variational structure admits the use of finite elements in time, which are based on the Discontinuous Galerkin method. An important feature is the possibility to select ‘goal-oriented’ error measures with great freedom. A key task is to identify and solve an auxiliary problem, that is the dual of the actual (primal) problem. Different strategies for computing the dual solution accurately, yet avoiding excessive cost, are investigated in the paper. In particular, we consider the characteristics at the limit of rate-independent plasticity.},

@article{Mieheetal1999,
abstract = {The paper presents a framework for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structure, which undergoes non-isothermal inelastic deformations at large strains. The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.},

A seamless implementation in ABAQUS is presented including Python script, validation problems and a web-link where script files, user-defined subroutines and input files can be accessed. For linear problems, we demonstrate how to utilize ABAQUS existing facilities to develop analysis attributes required for solving a unit-cell problem. For non-linear problems, a Python script invoked by a coarse-scale stress update procedure is introduced to carry out the scale bridging. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to motivate practitioners to adopt the computational homogenization as an integral part of their analysis and design process; and (ii) to encourage commercial code vendors to seamlessly integrate the architectures proposed in their legacy codes.},

abstract = {The appropriate thermodynamic setting for the combined configurational and deformational motion of standard continua is discussed in this paper. A key ingredient is an absolute (fixed) reference configuration, relative to which configurational and deformational changes (rates) with respect to the material (undeformed) and spatial (deformed) configurations, respectively, can be described in a unified fashion. In particular, we are interested in formulating the local as well as global measures of the energy dissipation due to configurational changes of a given physical system. It is believed that the presentation in this paper provides the following advantages: a unified kinematic and thermodynamic setting of the configurational and deformational motions, in particular the generic balance law accounting for configurational flux, increases the general clarity; the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the intrinsic change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation that is induced by configurational changes becomes transparent. All results are obtained without any restrictions on dynamics, thermomechanical couplings, etc.},

Moreover, the assumption typically made for computational purposes that its coefficients remain constant for all possible configurations is incompatible with elasticity. It is further shown that an assumption widely used in the computational literature in the context of finite deformation plasticity, namely, relating an objective stress rate to the rate of deformation tensor through a fourth-rank constant isotropic tensor, is also incompatible with elasticity, thus furnishing an example of an hypoelastic material which is not elastic.},

The fine scale is approximated by a sum of solutions to decoupled localized problems, which are solved numerically on a fine grid partition of a patch of coarse grid elements. The sizes of the patches of elements may be increased to control the error caused by localization. We derive an a posteriori error estimate in the energy norm which captures the dependency of the crucial discretization parameters: the coarse grid mesh size, the fine grid mesh size, and the sizes of the patches.

abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to present a critical review of available error-controlled adaptive finite element methods—with absolute global and goal-oriented error estimates—for approximate solutions of a given mathematical model and the model error of the considered mathematical model and its dimensions, enhanced with our own recent results in fracture mechanics. The second related important matter is which physical/mathematical models—including various boundary layers and other disturbances—and which accuracy of the finite element solutions in which norm are prescribed and necessary for the safety and reliability of a certain engineering problem, e.g. in structural engineering, of course depending on materials, systems and the type as well as the magnitude of prescribed loadings (i.e. actions in a factorized concept) acting on a specific structure. It is hard to understand why the current regulations for structural engineering design in Europe—especially the European Standards (Eurocodes) and the relevant German DIN-Codes (DIN: Deutsches Institut f\"{u}r Normung e. V.)—do not lay out any rules or bounds for the prescribed accuracy of the material and structural resistance, i.e. the validity of mechanical modelling and the accuracy of associated numerical methods, usually today the finite element method. It can be observed that behind the existing codes there still lies the old thinking of, e.g., classical elastic beam theory of so-called second order for stability problems and the corresponding elastic potential for plates and shells in buckling. Modern flexible finite element modelling by deriving theories in variational form for thin-walled beams, plates and shells from rather general 3D theories, for both linear and non-linear problems, capturing inelastic deformations and layer effects by material and dimensional expansions are not addressed in the Eurocodes for structural engineering. The necessary consequence is that joint work of computational mechanics specialists and structural engineers, working in national and international code-committees, is absolutely necessary, in order to avoid a lot of costly troubles and dangers of today by improving and updating the codes.},

abstract = {A gradient-enhanced computational homogenization procedure, that allows for the modelling of microstructural size effects, is proposed within a general non-linear framework. In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE). This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill-Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects.},

The new solution approach decomposes the hybrid system into a hierarchical global-local problem consisting of a positive definite global problem and an indefinite local system that are derived using minimization on the subspace and the stationarity principle, respectively. An innovative transformation of the indefinite local problem into an equivalent symmetric positive definite system makes the solution of the local problem possible either by a direct solver without pivoting or by a preconditioned iterative method. Alternative semi-iterative solution procedures for the case when auxiliary coarse grid is not available, are also developed. This includes a multigrid-like scheme that uses a mathematical model based on the collocation formulation as the auxiliary grid. Numerical performance studies for two-dimensional plane stress and shell problems are carried out to test the usefulness of the proposed procedures.},

abstract = {Modeling of elastic thin-walled beams, plates and shells as ID- and 2D-boundary value problems is valid in undisturbed subdomains. Disturbances near supports and free edges, in the vicinity of concentrated loads and at thickness jumps cannot be described in a sufficient way by 1D- and 2D-BVPs. In these disturbed subdomains dimensional (d)-adaptivity and model (m)-adaptivity have to be performed coupled with h- and/or p-adaptivity using hierarchically expanded test spaces in order to guarantee reliable and efficient overall results. The expansion strategy is applied for enhancing the spatial dimension and the model which is more efficient and evident for engineers than the reduction method. Using local residual error estimators of the primal problem in the energy norm by solving Dirichlet-problems on element patches, an efficient integrated adaptive calculation of the discretization—and the dimensional error is possible and reasonable, demonstrated by examples. We also present an error estimator of the dual problem, namely a posterior equilibrium method (PEM) for calculation of the interface tractions on local patches with Neumann boundary conditions, using orthogonality conditions. These tractions are equilibrated with respect to the global equilibrium condition of the stress resultants. An upper bound error estimator based on differences between the new tractions and the discontinuous tractions calculated from the stresses of the current finite element solution. The introduction of new element boundary tractions yields a method which can be regarded as a stepwise hybrid displacement method or as Trefftz method for local Neumann problems of element patches. An important advantage of PEM is the coupled computation of local discretization, dimensional- and model errors by an additive split.},

An important ingredient is a generalized macrohomogeneity condition. As part of the algorithm, the approach to the subscale modeling is chosen adaptively based on the relation of the macroscale mesh diameter to the typical length scale of the subscale structure. Moreover, the macroscale mesh adaptivity is driven by an estimation of discretization errors, which is an absolutely essential feature.

In the latter, the accuracy of numerical approximations is assessed in terms of measures that are of practical interest to engineers rather than the classical global energy norm. Goal-oriented error estimation requires the solution of a problem dual to the original problem and the computation of several global error estimates.

abstract = {A new residual type flux-free error estimator is presented. It estimates upper and lower bounds of the error in energy norm. The proposed approach precludes the main drawbacks of standard residual type estimators, circumvents the need of flux-equilibration and results in a simple implementation that uses standard resources available in finite element codes. This is specially interesting for 3D applications where the implementation of this technique is as simple as in 2D. Recall that on the contrary, the complexity of the flux-equilibration techniques increases drastically in the 3D case. The bounds for the energy norm of the error are used to produce upper and lower bounds of linear functional outputs, representing quantities of engineering interest. The presented estimators demonstrate their efficiency in numerical tests producing sharp estimates both for the energy and the quantities of interest.},

abstract = {This paper presents a two-scale approach for the mechanical and numerical modelling of materials with microstructure-like concrete or fibre-reinforced concrete in the non-linear regime. It addresses applications, where the assumption of scale separation as the basis for classical homogenization methods does not hold. This occurs when the resolution of micro and macro scale does not differ ab initio or when evolving fluctuations in the macro-fields are in the order of the micro scale during the loading progress. Typical examples are localization phenomena. The objective of the present study is to develop an efficient solution method exploiting the physically existing multiscale character of the problem. The proposed method belongs to the superposition-based methods with local enrichment of the large-scale solution ū by a small-scale part u′. The main focus of the present formulation is to allow for locality of the small-scale solution within the large-scale elements to achieve an efficient solution strategy. At the same time the small-scale information exchange over the large-scale element boundaries is facilitated while maintaining the accuracy of a refined complete solution. Thus, the emphasis lies on finding appropriate locality constraints for u′. To illustrate the method the formulation is applied to a damage mechanics based material model for concrete-like materials.},

The J-integral provides a criterion for crack propagation of a pre-existing crack. Therefore, its reliable and accurate evaluation is of considerable importance in engineering applications to prevent failure of structures. This can be achieved by goal-oriented adaptive finite element methods based on the well-established strategy of solving an auxiliary dual problem in order to control the error of a (non)linear functional, here the J-integral. In this paper, two principally different goal-oriented adaptive strategies are presented. The first strategy rests upon equilibrated residual error estimators based on local Neumann problems, whereas the second one makes use of averaging techniques.

@article{Hettigetal2007,
abstract = {Composites or multi-phase materials are characterized by a distinct heterogeneous microstructure. The failure modes of these materials are governed by several micromechanical effects like debonding phenomena and matrix cracks. The overall mechanical behavior of composites in the linear as well as the nonlinear regime is not only governed by the material properties of the components and their bonds but also by the material layout. In the present contribution the material structure is resolved and modeled on a small scale allowing to deal with these effects. For the numerical simulation we apply a combination of the extended finite-element method (X-FEM) [N. Mo\"{e}s, J. Dolbow, T. Belytschko, A finite element method for crack growth without remeshing, Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg. 46 (1999) 131–150] and the level set method (LSM) [S. Osher, J. Sethian, Fronts propagating with curvature dependent speed: algorithms based on Hamilton–Jacobi formulations, J. Comput. Phys. 79 (1988) 12–49]. In the X-FEM the finite-element approximation is enriched by appropriate functions through the concept of partition of unity. The geometry of material interfaces and cracks is described by the LSM. The combination of both, X-FEM and LSM, turns out to be very natural since the enrichment can be described and even constructed in terms of level set functions. In order to project the material behavior modeled on a small scale onto the large or structural scale, we employ the variational multiscale method (VMM) [T. Hughes, G. Feijoo, L. Mazzei, J.-B. Quiney, The variational multiscale method – a paradigm for computational mechanics, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 166 (1998) 3–24]. This concept is based on an additive split of the displacement field into large and small scale parts. For an efficient solution of the discrete problem we postulate that the small scale displacements are locally supported; in order to achieve this objective one has to assume appropriate constraint conditions. It can be shown that the applied numerical model allows a considerable flexibility concerning the variation of the material design and consequently of the mechanical behavior of a composite.},

The distinguishing characteristic of the proposed constitutive updates is that, by construction, the corresponding incremental stress—strain relations derive from a pseudo-elastic strain-energy density. This, in turn, confers the incremental boundary value problem a variational structure. In particular, the incremental deformation mapping follows from a minimum principle. This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption. The accuracy and robustness of the variational constitutive updates is demonstrated with the aid of convergence tests involving the finitely-deforming Mises solid and ductile single crystals. The ability of the updates to resolve the complex patterns of slip activity which arise in the latter application is particularly noteworthy.},

In this contribution, we discuss a posteriori error control of the material forces as part of an adaptive strategy to reduce the discretization error to an acceptable level. The data of the dual problem involves the quite non-conventional tangent stiffness of the (material) Eshelby stress tensor with respect to a variation of the (physical) strain field. The suggested strategy is applied to the common fracture mechanics problem of a single-edged crack, whereby different strategies for computing the J-integral are compared. We also consider the case in which the crack edges are not parallel, i.e. a notch.},

The framework involves the formulation of an optimization problem as the stationarity condition for a Lagrangian, whose arguments include an additional costate field in order to incorporate the state equation. This formulation has two distinct advantages: (1) The sensitivity of parameters with respect to uncertainties in the observed data can be assessed efficiently using a dual method, which compares favorably with the more conventional primal method, and (2) The errors arising from the FE discretization can be computed using the same dual method, which is an additional bonus. In fact, both the sensitivity and the discretization error can be estimated in an arbitrarily chosen “goal quantity” (or quantity of interest). Two numerical problems, one in terms of stationary groundwater flow (elliptic, in space) and another in terms of transient moisture diffusion in wood (parabolic, in space-time) illustrate the salient features of the proposed algorithm(s).},

Based on an appropriate dual problem, we compute a posteriori the discretization error contributions from approximations of the parameter, state and costate fields in space–time for an arbitrarily chosen goal-oriented error measure of engineering significance. Such a measure can be used in an adaptive strategy (not discussed in this paper) to meet a predefined error tolerance. An important observation is that the Jacobian matrix associated with the resulting Newton method is used (in principle) in solving the dual problem. Rather than treating the Jacobian in a monolithic fashion, we utilize a sequential solution strategy, whereby the FE-topology of the discretized state problem is used repeatedly. Moreover, the proposed solution strategy lends itself naturally to the computation of first and second order sensitivities, which are obtained with little extra computational effort. Numerical results are given for the prototype model of confined aquifer flow with spatially non-homogeneous permeability.

abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the development of three-dimensional ﬁnite element formulations suitable for the analysis of material failure at ﬁnite strains. Focus is on the simulation of complex failure patterns. For that purpose, a cohesive-type constitutive model is adopted and further elaborated. More precisely, a traction-separation law connecting the stress vector acting at a certain surface to a displacement jump such as a crack opening displacement is considered. A numerically eﬃcient implementation of this non-standard model is one of the ultimate goals of the present thesis. The advocated ﬁnite element formulation allows for a broad range of diﬀerent constitutive models. Furthermore, no restrictions regarding the space of the continuous displacement approximations are required, i.e., higher-order polynomials can be applied as well. For estimating the quality of the numerical solution a novel class of adaptive methods is presented in the second part of the thesis. Assuming the considered mechanical problem is driven by a variational principle such as energy minimization, so-called variational adaptive ﬁnite element formulations are developed. Within those methods, the state variables and the deformation mapping as well as an improved discretization are computed from the same overriding principle. The performance of those variational mesh adaptions is illustrated by means of two prototypes: variational r-adaptivity and variational h-adaptivity. Finally, the coupling of cohesive ﬁnite element formulations and variational mesh adaption is brieﬂy discussed.},

Due to the strong non-linearities involved in phase transformations, it is necessary to use a fine resolution in space-time in a finite element approximation in order to meet accuracy requirements. We derive space-time FE-methods based on the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin method in time for the energy equation. This formulation integrates the stored energy exactly for a given heat flux. When macro-segregation is incorporated into the model, the problem can be formulated in such a way that the phase-transition drives a flow of species. In addition, diffusion is possible throughout the domain. The model can be further rewritten using a potential approach. By this approach for modelling macro-segregation, we are able to obtain discretizations that guarantee that the balance equations are satisfied, and it is possible to solve the phase-transition problem either as a field problem or as a local problem (defined by a local evolution rule).},

abstract = {The paper investigates algorithms for the computation of homogenized stresses and overall tangent moduli of microstructures undergoing small strains. Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems. We demonstrate their performance for some representative model problems including elastic–plastic deformations of composite materials.},

abstract = {Three non-dispersive models in multi-dimensions have been developed. The first model consists of a leading-order homogenized equation of motion subjected to the secularity constraints imposing uniform validity of asymptotic expansions. The second, non-local model, contains a fourth-order spatial derivative and thus requires C1 continuous finite element formulation. The third model, which is limited to the constant mass density and a macroscopically orthotropic heterogeneous medium, requires C0 continuity only and its finite element formulation is almost identical to the classical local approach with the exception of the mass matrix. The modified mass matrix consists of the classical mass matrix (lumped or consistent) perturbed with a stiffness matrix whose constitutive matrix depends on the unit cell solution. Numerical results are presented to validate the present formulations.},

abstract = {The estimation of unknown excitation or input signals from measured response is essentially the solution of an optimization problem; a function representing the input is sought such that the discrepancy between measured and simulated response is minimized. From the view of optimization it is convenient to consider the general situation where the governing differential equations may be time-variant and non-linear. Moreover, the choice of parameterization for the sought input, sampling instances of measurement data and discretization of the state problem are all decoupled, in contrast to standard methods such as Dynamic Programming. In this paper, the optimization problem is solved by seeking a stationary point of the pertinent Lagrangian functional, resulting in a Newton-type iterative algorithm. Moreover, the sensitivity of the solution with respect to measurement noise may also be estimated from a perturbation analysis of the optimality conditions. Two numerical examples show that the approach produces results in agreement with those of standard methods, however, with the additional advantage the numerical properties of the considered problem may be investigated. In particular, such knowledge may be used for choosing a proper amount of regularization.},

@phdthesis{Lillbacka2007,
abstract = {This thesis deals with the modeling and simulation of the influence of the material substructure on the macroscopic mechanical properties of duplex stainless steel (DSS). Two subscale levels and their interaction are considered: Grain structure (mesoscale) and crystallographic structure (microscale). Typical mesoscale parameters are the volume fraction, morphology and material properties of the two phases (ferrite and austenite). A multiscale modeling approach is adopted, whereby it is assumed that the macro- and mesoscales are separated such that it is possible to model the subscale effects within a representative volume element (RVE) and to obtain the macroscale response via volume averaging (computational homogenization). A new microscale material model based on crystal (visco)plasticity and damage has been developed as part of the thesis work. This model is used to study the evolution of damage within the grain structure of the RVE. The important issue of parameter identification of the material parameters in the crystal plasticity model is also considered. Specifically, the necessary macroscale experiments needed for obtaining a unique set of material parameter values is exploited. Finally, concurrent (FE$^2$) multiscale modeling simulations are performed. Different types of plane stress conditions in 2D simulations and the computation of the corresponding macroscale algorithmic tangent stiffness (ATS) tensor are discussed. The concurrent simulations are used for investigating the influence of cold--working on the macroscale mechanical properties for a thin metal sheet with strongly inhomogeneous deformation and stress states.},

These include: coupled mechanical and nonmechanical overall properties of heterogeneous piezoelectric materials, new upper and lower bounds for these coupled properties, a systematic comparison between the average-field theory and the results obtained using multi-scale perturbation theory, an account of the uniform-field theory, improveable bounds on overall moduli of heterogeneous materials which remain finite even when isolated cavities and rigid inclusions are present, and a brief account of a fundamental duality principle in anisotropic elasticity. In addition, better explanations of a number of topics are given, more recent references are added, the Subject Index has been expanded and printing and typographical errors have been corrected. The material is organized into two parts preceded by a pr\'{e}cis. Part 1 consists of four chapters which are organized into fourteen sections and four appendixes. It deals with materials with microdefects such as cavities, cracks, and inclusions, as well as with elastic composites. Part 2 consists of two chapters which are divided into seven sections. It provides an introduction to the theory of linear elasticity, added to make the book self-contained, since linear elasticity serves as the basis of the development of small-deformation micromechanics. Part 2 mainly contains part of the lecture notes on elasticity which the first author wrote in the late 1960's. The material is mostly standard, given for background information.},

The principles of the method rely on a two-scale computational homogenization approach which is applied successfully for the stress analysis of multi-phase solids under purely mechanical loading. The present paper extends this methodology to heat conduction problems. The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail. A nested finite element solution procedure is outlined, and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some illustrative example problems.},

@article{Peraireetal2006,
abstract = {We present a method for the computation of upper and lower bounds for linear-functional outputs of the exact solutions to the two dimensional elasticity equations. The method can be regarded as a generalization of the well known complementary energy principle. The desired output is cast as the supremum of a quadratic-linear convex functional over an infinite dimensional domain. Using duality the computation of an upper bound for the output of interest is reduced to a feasibility problem for the complementary, or dual, problem. In order to make the problem tractable from a computational perspective two additional relaxations that preserve the bounding properties are introduced. First, the domain is triangulated and a domain decomposition strategy is used to generate a sequence of independent problems to be solved over each triangle. The Lagrange multipliers enforcing continuity are approximated using piecewise linear functions over the edges of the triangulation. Second, the solution of the adjoint problem is approximated over the triangulation using a standard Galerkin finite element approach. A lower bound for the output of interest is computed by repeating the process for the negative of the output. Reversing the sign of the computed upper bound for the negative of the output yields a lower bound for the actual output. The method can be easily generalized to three dimensions. However, a constructive proof for the existence of feasible solutions for the outputs of interest is only given in two dimensions. The computed bound gaps are found to converge optimally, that is, at the same rate as the finite element approximation. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that it allows for a data set to be generated that can be used to certify and document the computed bounds. Using this data set and a simple algorithm, the correctness of the computed bounds can be established without recourse to the original code used to compute them. In the present paper, only computational domains whose boundary is made up of straight sided segments and polynomially varying loads are considered. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

@article{BeckerRannacher1996,
abstract = {Recently a refined approach to error control in finite element (FE) discretisations has been proposed, Becker and Rannacher (1995b), (1996), which uses weighted a posteriori error estimates derived via duality arguments. The conventional strategies for mesh refinement in FE models of problems from elasticity theory are mostly based on a posteriori error estimates in the energy norm. Such estimates reflect the approximation properties of the finite element ansatz by local interpolation constants while the stability properties of the continuous model enter through a global coercivity constant. However, meshes generated on the basis of such global error estimates are not appropriate in cases where the domain consists of very heterogeneous materials and for the computation of local quantities, e.g., point values or contour integrals. This deficiency is cured by using certain local norms of the dual solution directly as weights multiplying the local residuals of the computed solution. In general, these weights have to be evaluated numerically in the course of the refinement process, yielding almost optimal meshes for various kinds of error measures. This feed-back approach is developed here for primal as well as mixed FE discretisations of the fundamental problem in linear elasticity.},

abstract = {The interest in adaptive strategies for the finite element method is growing at a fast pace. Researchers are now fully convinced that this should be part of any numerical modelling and try to incorporate the methodology to their problems. Even the industry begins to require such an approach to increase the quality of the numerical results and to get more effective analyses to increase the ratio between computer costs and target error level. The adaptive strategy has first been applied to linear elliptic problems, e.g. linear infinitesimal elasticity [1,6,17,11]). It is now enlarged to nonlinear and transient problems [12–16,5,10,17]. It is the aim of this paper to illustrate the application of the technique of residuals to adaptive refinement of coupled problems and to elastic wave propagation. There are many other approaches to a posteriori error estimations. Some of them appear to be difficult to extend to coupled and transient problems. It is believed that the residual approach is versatile enough to be easily applied to more complex problems. The two basic ideas used here rely on a space-time Galerkin formulation which provides a variational formulation of the error with respect to the residual, and the adjoint state which gives an upper bound of the error by the norm of the residuals weighted by some power of h and $\Delta$t, extending the ideas of Eriksson et al. [5].},

In this paper we focus on the Representative Volume Element (RVE) that is commonly taken for granted in most of deterministic as well as in stochastic solid mechanics, although in the latter case it is called the Statistical Volume Element (SVE). The key issue is the scale over which homogenization is being carried out—it is called the mesoscale, separating the microscale (level of microheterogeneities) from the macroscale (level of RVE). As the mesoscale grows, the SVE tends to become the RVE. This occurs in terms of two hierarchies of bounds stemming from Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems on the mesoscale, respectively. Since generally there is no periodicity in real random media, the RVE can only be approached approximately on finite scales. We review results on this subject in the settings of linear elasticity, finite elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, thermoelasticity, and permeability.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a model to characterize the deterioration of mechanical responses of microheterogeneous solids due to progressive microstructural failure with increased loading. In the approach, the effects of microscopic failure, so-called “relaxation”, are described by a variational boundary value problem with constraints on the microfields. The extent of the relaxation, which is induced by reducing the eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor at a point in the heterogeneous body, is dictated by the condition that the solution must satisfy the equations of equilibrium, and simultaneously the constraints at that point. Theoretical properties of the model are determined and a computational algorithm is developed to simulate the deterioration of the material microstructure. Numerical simulations involving the finite element method are given to illustrate various aspects of the model.},

The quasicontinuum method links atomistic and continuum models through the device of the finite element method which permits a reduction of the full set of atomistic degrees of freedom. The present paper gives a full description of the quasicontinuum method, with special reference to the ways in which the method may be used to model crystals with more than a single grain. The formulation is validated in terms of a series of calculations on grain boundary structure and energetics. The method is then illustrated in terms of the motion of a stepped twin boundary where a critical stress for the boundary motion is calculated and nanoindentation into a solid containing a subsurface grain boundary to study the interaction of dislocations with grain boundaries.},

Generally, residual error estimators (which have at least upper bound in contrast to indicators) can be locally computed from residua of equilibrium and stress-jumps at element interfaces using Dirichlet or Neumann conditions for element patches or individual elements (REM). Another equivalent method for error estimation can be derived from a posteriori computed improved boundary tractions which provide exact equilibrium of elements. They are computed from local Neumann problems and yield improved local solution by testing with higher test functions. This method is called Posterior Equilibrium Method (PEM) and yields better efficiency indices than REM for the investigated problem, even in case of locking. Also, the important feature of model-adaptivity via hierarchical error estimation can only be realized by this strategy. Global Neumann-type estimators and examples are presented for elastic and elastoplastic deformations, controlling equilibrium in tangential space.},

This approach allows us to compare the material response at different scales. A macroscopic stress–strain curve can be derived from the force–displacement response of the mesh. On the other hand, all the grains having the same crystallographic orientation can be taken in a unique phase, and the average response can be compared with models assuming uniform stresses/strains in each phase. Considering each grain individually allows us to characterise the effect of the surrounding grains. Finally, an analysis of the results inside the grains provides information about the relative contributions of the core of the grain and the grain boundary to the deformation/hardening process. The results obtained at the different scales are compared for various types of geometries, assuming either that the cube is in the material or that one or several faces are free surfaces.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with an efficient, variationally consistent, implementation for rate-independent dissipative solids at finite strain. More precisely, focus is on finite strain plasticity theory based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. Adopting the formalism of standard dissipative solids which allows to describe constitutive models by means of only two potentials being the Helmholtz energy and the yield function (or equivalently, a dissipation functional), finite strain plasticity is recast into an equivalent minimization problem. In contrast to previous models, the presented framework covers isotropic and kinematic hardening as well as isotropic and anisotropic elasticity and yield functions. Based on this approach a novel numerical implementation representing the main contribution of the paper is given. In sharp contrast to by now classical approaches such as the return-mapping algorithm and analogously to the theoretical part, the numerical formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all unknown variables follow naturally from minimizing the energy of the considered system. Consequently, several different numerically efficient and robust optimization schemes can be directly employed for solving the resulting minimization problem. Extending previously published works on variational constitutive updates, the advocated model does not rely on any material symmetry and therefore, it can be applied to a broad range of different plasticity theories. As two examples, an anisotropic Hill-type and a Barlat-type model are implemented. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and the performance of the proposed implementation.},

In this paper, adaptive mesh refinement based on the pertinent dual solution is used in order to reduce discretization errors in the calibrated material parameters. By a sensitivity assessment, the influence from uncertainties in experimental data is estimated, which serves as a threshold under which there is no need to further reduce the discretization error. The adaptive strategy is employed to calibrate a viscoelasticity model with observed data from uniaxial compression (i.e., homogeneous stress state), where the FE-discretization in time is studied.

This requires a product development process that utilizes the possibility to simulate the product performance using modeling of different degrees of sophistication at any predefined level-of-detail (LOD). For example, the mechanical properties of a cast component depend strongly on the casting process, the simulation of which requires complex modeling at a high LOD. In this article, we propose an optimization strategy that is based on the LOD concept to develop cost-effective components. A sizing optimization of a cast model component is carried out with respect to both the mechanical and thermal response to exemplify the process. In particular, a (novel) global measure of the temperature in energy norm is introduced as an indicator of the “production fitness” to ensure high quality of the material properties. This measure is the thermal counterpart of the well-accepted mechanical strain energy.},

abstract = {The paper investigates computational procedures for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structures of inelastic constituents undergoing small strains. The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites.},

Suitable solution methods introduce a multifield scenario of hierarchically superimposed states on different length scales. For big differences of micro- and macro-scales, the argument of scale separation induces the application of homogenization methods. Such types of physical multiscale approaches can be treated by nested multilevel finite element analyses that discretize both the fine-scale micro-structure as well as the macroscopic boundary-value problem. In contrast, small-scale differences require full resolution of the heterogeneous structure. Effective solution methods for the resulting large-scale problems with strongly oscillating properties are suitably designed geometric multigrid techniques, which may be considered as numerical multiscale approaches. In both scenarios, a key ingredient is the suitable formulation of scale bridging algorithms that govern the transfer between different scales. The paper outlines new mesh-bridging techniques in a deformation-driven context for fully non-linear response, which exploit in a non-trivial manner weak constraints on the average deformation in typical finite element patches. The framework is based on an incremental variational structure of finite inelasticity. The proposed new formulations provide variational-based homogenization algorithms for physical multiscale scenarios and problem-dependent optimal finite element grid transfers for numerical multiscale scenarios of heterogeneous materials.},

@article{Aubryetal2003,
abstract = {We present a practical algorithm for partially relaxing multiwell energy densities such as pertain to materials undergoing martensitic phase transitions. The algorithm is based on sequential lamination, but the evolution of the microstructure during a deformation process is required to satisfy a continuity constraint, in the sense that the new microstructure should be reachable from the preceding one by a combination of branching and pruning operations. All microstructures generated by the algorithm are in static and configurational equilibrium. Owing to the continuity constraint imposed upon the microstructural evolution, the predicted material behavior may be path-dependent and exhibit hysteresis. In cases in which there is a strict separation of micro- and macrostructural lengthscales, the proposed relaxation algorithm may effectively be integrated into macroscopic finite-element calculations at the sub-grid level. We demonstrate this aspect of the algorithm by means of a numerical example concerned with the indentation of a Cu–Al–Ni shape memory alloy by a spherical indenter.},

@article{HJetal2005,
abstract = {In order to determine the parameter values for the constituents of a nonlinear elastic composite on the mesoscale, while experimental data are available on the macroscale only, a meso-macro-transition approach is adopted. A representative volume element (RVE) with piecewise linear Dirichlet boundary conditions, is analyzed using a recently proposed technique for the calibration of constitutive models. The strategy is based on an optimization problem expressed such that the state equation is incorporated via an additional costate field, which has the distinct advantage that error control in an arbitrary “goal” quantity is formally straightforward. The practical solution of the optimization problem is essentially based on Newton's method, which is feasible since it is possible to decompose each Newton step in a number of linear problems using the conventional finite element structure for the RVE problem. The same problem character is pertinent to the solution of the dual problem for a given choice of error measure, which is the key ingredient in the a posteriori error computation. The numerical results show the effectivity of the error prediction for the special case when the material parameters are constant within the subdomains of mesostructural constituents.},

@article{TemizerWriggers2008,
abstract = {In this contribution, methods of computing the macroscopic tangent that is required in multiscale volumetric homogenization problems are investigated. A condensation procedure that employs the tangent information from the microscale finite element analysis is derived within a special framework where deformation controlled boundary conditions in micromechanical testing are enforced via the penalty method. The developed methodology is demonstrated by sample macroscale problems in the context of the multilevel finite element strategy. Due to the high memory allocation costs that the condensation procedure induces, a perturbation procedure is developed based on a minimal number of micromechanical tests. Results from the condensation and perturbation procedures are compared for sample infinitesimal and finite deformation inelasticity problems and the algorithmic consistency of the macroscopic tangent with the evolution of the macroscopic stress is discussed. It is shown that the ability to compute the macroscopic tangent can also be employed to construct a stress controlled micromechanical testing procedure.},
