The macroscale is a volumetrically compressible problem, characterized by a varying density in a green body (compressed powder).
In contrast, the subscale is modeled as a incompressible free surface Stokes flow, driven by surface tension.

For the macroscale, a straight forward implementation of the momentum-balance equation is used, coupled to the micro problems through the Gauss points. 

In the subscale, surface tension is modeled by \emph{specialized surface elements}. For the free surface flow, a \emph{Grid Base Particle Method} (GBPM) is implemented for tracking the active surface. Updating the velocities means finding elements using an \emph{Octree based localizer}.
Remeshing is done with \emph{Triangle} whenever the mesh quality drops too low or whenever large topological changes occur. 

The prolongation for the Dirichlet boundary conditions were implemented with a specialized boundary condition for \emph{prescribed gradients}.
Using these structures, the computational homogenization was written in a few simple lines of code.

The macroscale problem is a creeping flow, and the microscale is described by a incompressible Stokes flow.

The coupled FE\textsuperscript{2} problem has been implemented in OOFEM in the heat transfer and fluid mechanics module respectively.
For the microscale problem, the periodic boundary conditions are implemented using \emph{slave DOF's}.

The nonlinear system of equations are solved with \emph{line-search}.
