\section*{Preface}
In this study the forces from aerodynamic simulations have been used to analyze the vibrational behaviour of a high speed train in respect to comfort and stability. A scenario of two trains meeting and a scenario of a train leaving a tunnel with a strong side wind are simulated.
The work has been carried out from September 2008 to April 2009 at the Department of \departmentname, Division of \divisionnameA\ and Division of \divisionnameB, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, with Mikael \"Ohman as student and Professor Viktor Berbyuk as supervisor for the vibration dynamics and Erik Bjerklund as student and Associate Professor Sini\v{s}a Krajnovi\'{c} as supervisor for the fluid mechanics.

\section*{Aknowledgements}
We would like to say our thanks to our supervisors and the department of \departmentname\ for their support, to Albin Jonsson for his help with the vibration dynamics and to the CFD support at AVL, Dr. Branislav Basara, Andreas Diemath and J\"urgen Schneider. A special thanks to AVL for providing the Fire licenses.
Without their help this project would not have been possible.
